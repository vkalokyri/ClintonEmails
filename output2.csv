Op-Ed
The world after Petraeus
Obama should seize this chance to adjust his foreign policy.
By Sarah Chayes
November 15, 2012
The scandal enveloping members of America's adulated top brass is the deepest crisis to hit the military in
decades. It is a crisis President Obama did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during a
major transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this
one to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation
with military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political.
The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair
came to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies,
creates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of
non-military approaches.
When he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President
George W. Bush as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was
reflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then,
Obama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man
could offer him.
Petraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a
military solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed
with Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy
approach.
With the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different — concerned
about the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to
pay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice. His focus as commander of

the troops in Afghanistan — and even more so at the CIA — was on a type of warfare better suited to this
president: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control.
But such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a military
answer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and
cultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special
ops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the
same old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to
employ which tactics to defeat the enemy?
What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the
other tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and
legal leverage.
Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating
lack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was
stunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S.
officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular
government. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind.
The first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core
function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the
secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone
in the air, as has been reported, that's 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining
an intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at
the helm of the CIA.
Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of
transition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign
policy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart,
adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be
attracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents.
But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death
of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive
ways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack.
Stevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the
region to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment
and helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically
untenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled.
And faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a
secretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench.
Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand,
restructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the
current crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.

Hope you are well and had a nice Easter. Had a terrific trip to Middle East...boy, is the Secretary a hit there!
Good neWs....Heather Samuelson has informed me that I have received
Everything has been submitted and I am hoping that I can be thru the process by May 7 in
order to go to the NPT review conference in NY. Hopefully will be confirmed by then, too.
Sharon Hardy has arranged for me to come to State on Wednesday at 10 am to get my security badge and DS briefing. I
will have a temporary office in the Transition area until I am confirmed.
Do you have some time Wednesday morning...or can we have lunch? I'd like to hear how the situation is
flushing out and go over some ideas/issues with you. I'm leaving town Thursday for a long weekend on what expect will
be my last Congressional break.
All the best,

Dear Burns,
It was good to talk with you again this morning. I am grateful for your willingness to help the Council of Bishops. The
following are dates and times that are available:
Sunday, May 3, 6:00 PM dinner - This is the opening dinner for the Council in which all of the bishops will be present. It
will be at the American University Katzman Arts Center (right on the Nebraska Circle).
Wednesday, May 6, 6:00 PM dinner - Again all of the bishops will be present. This dinner will be at the Bethesda Hyatt,
7400 Wisconsin Avenue.

John and Burns, Great talking to you both this evening.
Burns, the United Methodist Bishops from around the world are coming to the Washington area for a weeklong
gathering of bishops. Bishop John is host and arranging their schedule. John can tell you more details ...
it would be wonderful if a time could be found sometime during the week
(Sunday-Friday) for Hillary to meet with the entire group of bishops (around 100 total) or at least the leaders of the
African bishops (perhaps a group of 10 or so).

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758447 Date: 06/30/2015
John notes that the group can be flexible and accomodate Hillary's busy schedule. He suggests that there are a couple
of ideal evening opportunities where all the bishops will be present: this Sunday evening at 6 pm at American
University's Arts Center, or Wednesday at 6 pm at the Hyatt in Bethesda. There also is a Tuesday evening gathering and
reception with just the African bishops -- 7 pm onwards at AP Shaw UMC in SE DC.
If it is not possible for her to go to the bishops, I wonder whether it might be possible for a smaller group (eg, John, the
African bishops and a couple others) to come to the State Department for a meeting in the Secretary's suite or
conference room on the 7th floor. The Secretary obviously has a very busy schedule, but it might well be possible to find
20-30 minutes sometime during the week at the Department. (I haven't yet done so, but I will check the State Dept
website and see what her announced travel schedule is.)
I am happy to help however I can, though it probably is easiest if you coordinate directly. Feel free to copy me at the
above emails if I can be helpful. Here are your cell numbers: Bishop John's is
Burns's is
God's blessings to you both,

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The ""surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick up on—
the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed information about
Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of things that have been covered
in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and much more focused on Branch than I
had anticipated. While not as "and this day, and the next day" as My Life, it does share many of the same elements that
would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that there appears to be no index also makes it difficult
for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore, WIC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection
through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC quotes was far fewer than I had expected.
HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with Branch
when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the Gephardt comment,
and didn't grab much attention at all.[1] (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought that there should not be a
special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much aligned with her interactions with
Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in the book are those, which face the current
Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion of the
Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his connection with the
events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are strikingly sparsely discussed
such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not appear as thought WJC ever-dodged
questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life, one theme that repeated itself was WJC's
conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few
instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there
are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on
more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch could
write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends, later quashed,
who slept over while NBC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does portray a helpful distinction in
how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have
him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are
some quips that could catch someone's eye, such as WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't
even recognize."
Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no other
lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason he didn't
mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if she was found to
be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a very small passage that
could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this before. (This is addressed more
fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship with Gore,
which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with Janet Reno. The
one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues are discussed in turn
below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed in a much more human light
than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her relationship with CVC and images of
affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.
On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans, China, Russia,
Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about Haiti is about Branch's own
experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion about North Korea, but nothing that has
not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in what seems to track mention of him in My Life,
which seems to have more detail and background than this book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the USSS
cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets would be lined

with "assassins." There are candid looks at WIC's take on certain people and the relationship between some, such as
Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's drinking, such as yelling outside of
Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders going, but
Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained interpretation of
the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Life only mentions Lee's
accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from Branch's book the first giving context
and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security agencies,
indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his personal computer. Lee
was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown, solitary confinement—even though the
long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to China or anyone else. The president said experts were
telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged.
Nothing would please him more than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
0 While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret, uncharged and
untried...He [WIC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without foreseeing such arbitrary
detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the legal limit...whether to bring charges on the
testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for
more than six months. One extreme detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American.
We accept guilty people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom." [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could send her
to jail, as she had denied it.
0 "Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of the affair. If
Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could have turned him into a
witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while original, struck me as tendentious. The
president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of
Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.
0 There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he complained that
if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to say "it was interesting, in fact,
that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet,
announcing gladly that his worries were over because the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she
replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She
said Kissing blanched, speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered
that his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,' Hillary
repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life." [Branch, 179]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
HRC and gay/lesbian
Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how W1C's counsel got very "exercised." WJC left the room. "He
was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life than Hillary.' He sighed. Her
temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues were even mentionable. New York
politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take. On the other hand, personal experience
could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with Moynihan.
For example:
0 When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could fight for
themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a freebie for him,' snapped
Clinton, 'and he knows it." [p.140]
0 In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WIC] faulted Senator Moynihan for aimless
hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]
0 Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a number of
them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was sure they had nothing to
hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely on the surface, never
produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny himself for five minutes, living in an apartment
secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182]
0 "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted hypothetical
about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, "He doesn't understand...that he's conceding the principles."
WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press and said that Moynihan knew what he
was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption about Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several examples
follow:
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the Clintons, with
the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room...Their agenda was a delicate race between Hussein's
failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of
national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed
electrical grids, and so on. Hussein gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch, 170]
0 South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule was far more demanding than
ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden women." [Branch, 236] Later
Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast with a superficial American press, which portrayed
Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords
with whirlwind encouragements for citizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting
Bhutto corresponds to a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, "she [HRC] played the traditional role of
First Lady as wife and mother...") [Branch, 246]
0 China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she depicted the
"harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the rave reviews of HRC's speech.
[Branch, 289]
0 Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed from urgent political
tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact with her
throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs gratitude, but the
fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.
0 "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called Chelsea at
Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was another story. Jesse said he
knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in American politics. He did not know everything
involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now
above all, and if she needed to counsel, rage, or pray, he was always available." [Branch, 497]
Tension with Janet Reno
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative opinion of
Janet Reno.
0 "He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney general. If he
removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall
to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's wholesale devotion to outside control for any
case in which the president himself may become a target...lf he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would
touch off a firestorm of protest like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the
Watergate scandal. That was not an option." [Branch, 388-389]
0 Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and continuing to
allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy. Branch then outlines a meeting
between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her "desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like
that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I
hired her to work for me." [Branch, 398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good
achievements including coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on
Whitewater, but that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno had failed to
defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension the entire executive
branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her more naïve than upright, and the
fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch, 399] He cites that Clinton warned her that she should prepare
herself for not staying in the job for the entire second term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter
There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to North Korea
and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be on the front lines.
North Korea:
0 "On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore, and Clinton had
approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme isolation...Sure enough, Carter did reach North
Korean dictator Kim II-sung, who proposed to allow inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief
from the harsh economic sanctions. The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became
official, adding gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters, and he did not
believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt." [Branch, 1621
Haiti:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with Gore (who said
Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to Haiti to seek a truce with the
junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis' (arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus
what was in the United States' best interest). He didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North
Korea, Carter again, Carter went to the press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and
Carter, invited to stay over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the
next morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not right...The
press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent negotiators... He said the
current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that
Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with
restraint at their joint press conference, he allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he
had earned the right to speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the
United States government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-resident." [Branch,
200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
0 "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush. 'Dole will
support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he doesn't have much positive to
say." [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places where he is
briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the seemingly brutally candid
conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.
0 On page 92 Branch writes, "No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as alleged, but to
improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin." [Branch, 92]
0 In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also having Gore
substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other nations were offended that
Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to redeem himself and the administration for his
absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC "pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked.
So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to
take these exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and
were still wrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]

0 On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as a team to
secure the Cabinet for the second term.
0 Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second criminal
lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is about a leak of an offer
from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free. The exchange is more on ethics of the
offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
0 On Gore's announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his kickoff events—
once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were technical...But Gore got all the big
things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly
what he would do for them in the White House. The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third,
Gore would be badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post." [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues that
WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his campaign. "On tape, the president said he
confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must
project his platform—where he stood, precisely how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans
would try to knock him off substance." [Branch, 554]
0 WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not succeeding
him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart, experience, and motivated.
He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential character over detailed agendas for the
country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," but Clinton discounted this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would
wear well over time. Gore also was perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence,
which called for Gore to emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a
brooding quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature failed to
give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch, 599]
0 He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said the
president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had it not been for the vice
president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who would be a bright spot to run with,
perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though
she would never get chosen. How much of this was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is
unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
0 WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be running essentially for a
third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would tarnish them with Clinton's
character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate that had been heard before—that Gore lacked
style and a light touch.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in one of their
stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he meant good on the policy,
and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend the two. Gore said he had to think about
it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the
message that Clinton must convey somehow without seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch, 623-624]
0 The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure at first
about recording the details. At the outset it says, "For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did he blame Clinton for his
defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him did." [Branch, 642] It has WJC
acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the White House. Then he says, "I think you made a
mistake not to use me more in the last ten days," Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much
more upset about your message, now that we're being honest." [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought
bag saying that "Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an "unparalleled" vice president, but that
he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was "surreal."
o Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal had been
the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers
had tormented him now for four years. Gore said he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered
telling the president that he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for trouble. So he did
blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be
in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought he was in Neverland,' he said." [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported Clinton all through
the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated
that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened.
There was little to say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake. He
had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis. Well, he said, this is the first
time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed.
Their colliding perspectives made both of them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so
significant here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed honesty that
somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..." [Branch, 644-45]
Other
0 Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking Maggie to compile
confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. "Williams was shrewd, discreet, and efficient." [Branch, 161]
HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's suggestion to invade
Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the pressure, the lack of options, and his

sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign policy staff. He said she observed with some
suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake, Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed
the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray Inman as defense secretary." [Branch, 189]
0 ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book. Quinn said that
HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn. HRC said Feinman had withdrawn
from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be
about him and how it affected him as a ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor
that HRC and a female veterinarian of Socks' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House."
[Branch, 342-343]
0 Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had subpoenaed all
those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were there. This included "some two
dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed the subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]
0 Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, "In our glancing
associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as lighthearted or
recreational." [Branch, 495]
0 Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their best chance
to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, 'but I don't think Al would ever do it." [Branch, 540]
WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting HRC if she
decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the two events are unconnected.
"When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He .
could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..." [Branch, 557]
0 On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because "of hard intelligence
that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses the cancelled trip but does
not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.

• Subj: list of 5 update
Hello Melanne,
Well the list of 5 continues to be a Quizomba dance (a bit forward, a bit backward).
On the positive.
The two, Mosala and Pitchen, that had been commanders in Kimia II, have finally been changed. They are
supposedly in route to Kinshasa.
That means none of the 5 are now in active operational command position.
This is positive.
All 5 are supposedly in Kinshasa, but not yet confirmed. 2 are in the central prison in Kinshasa.
On the negative.
None of the 5 have been charged. 2 are arbitrarily detained.
More negative.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759743 Date: 06/30/2015
We received attached request•this week for support to investigate the cases of the 5 officers. While only about
$70,000, the request is strange and worrying. In 4 of the cases an open file in North or South Kivu military prosecutors
office exists. Only in the case of should the Military Prosecutor General need to be involved, given the B6
rank of the suspect.
In all 5 cases the local military prosecutor had opened a legal investigation and had interviewed all the victims.
The cases were stopped by political or financial intervention. Now the request indicates the Military Prosecutor General
needs to fly all over the country to investigate. Not only is the request 18 months late in coming, it makes no sense. In 4
of 5 cases, the military prosecutor in the Province has jurisdiction. They just need to continue their work. With the
suspects all in Kinshasa, it makes their work more difficult.
Is someone trying to make some money? Were they given the impression that the international community is
so interested in this case, but the government is not? Or is there so little trust in the local prosecutors that central
government wants more control? Or do governmental officials know so little about how criminal cases function that
they are inadvertently delaying procedures.
Conclusion. Lobby has been effective to remove from position of active command. Political intervention has not
had desired impact in terms of judicial action.
To be continued.
Have a good weekend.

Dear Hillary,
I very much hope we have a chance to spend some time with you next week for the ""Sanya Initiatove" in DC with four
other American Four Stars and our Chinese counterparts. You will recall this is part of what I've been trying to do under
our "complementary engagement" program, which I briefly mentioned to you.
I understand our offices are working on the schedules, but nothing is firm yet.
Your personal involvement with this group - perhaps a small lunch - would be a very important message seen at the
highest levels of the Chinese government and the Central Military Commission.
I'd be personally grateful not only on behalf of our group, but also on behalf of a cause that I believe will be a part of
leading to a trusting relationship between our militaries so that we will have friends in China - not enemies.,
Warm, best regards,
Bill

Welcome thoughts. I expect to hear further from French today what specifically they have in mind. She could still go to
Paris, but perhaps better not to let them do the Afpak meeting.

• ARKADELPHIA — Johnnie Mae Walker Spargo was born on the first day of Spring, March 20, 1919, and from that
day until her last on this earth, Nov. 8, 2009, she cast her beautiful blue eyes and dimpled smile on all of those around
her.
Johnnie Mae was the youngest daughter of Garland Lee and Nettie Mann Walker of Red Oak, Arkansas, now part of Hot
Springs on the southeast shores of Lake Hamilton. She was predeceased by her parents and siblings, Claude, Eddie,
Grady, Hansel, Clara, Isli, and Doyle. She was predeceased by her loving husband of 67 years, Stephen Fowler Spargo,
and by Jamie and Billy Gibbs, her daughter and sonin-law, and her son-in-law Allen Brown DeLamar. The Spargos, natives
of Hot Springs, made Arkadelphia home when Steve joined Reynolds Aluminum Company in 1954.
Mrs. Spargo is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Byron and Mary Lynda Spargo, of Baton Rouge, La., and her
daughters, Nancy Spargo DeLamar, of Little Rock, and Dr. Linda Spargo, of Oxford, Miss. Her grandchildren include
Megan DeLamar Schroeder and her husband, Trey, of Texarkana; Hattie Alton of Oxford, Miss.; Johni Beth Gibbs and her
fiance Jeremy Teague of Sheridan; Gwendy Clingman and her husband, Ed, of Mechanicsville, Va.; and Leslie Spargo of
Baton Rouge. Johnnie Mae was especially proud of her great-grandchildren: Frances and Eleanor Schroeder and Ryan
and Lauren Clingman.
She was a fierce and loyal advocate for each and every one of her offspring and truly believed that they could be
anything in the world they wanted to be. She was a member of the First Methodist Church in Arkadelphia. Johnnie Mae
was a pre-school teacher for many years at Margo Nelson's Wonderland School in Arkadelphia. She also helped her
community as a constant and reliable election poll worker. Even though Johnnie Mae was determined that she not be
perceived as a retiring little granny, her family was her universe. She was a strong, vibrant woman with black hair coiffed
on top of her head and clicking high heels, and she had beautiful skin that all of her progeny hope to inherit. She
believed in living to the fullest until the end, doing good works, helping all whom she encountered in ways that she
could, and imbuing her children and grandchildren with a strong work ethic and deep empathy for those less fortunate.
Many people in Arkansas have been the recipient of one of her lemon butter pound cakes for doing something kind for
one of her girls. When she won the 2003 Clark County Democrat of the Year, Johnnie Mae was described as a cross
between Eva Peron and Mary Poppins.
Johnnie Mae made her mark on Arkadelphia, determined that her children would enjoy to the fullest the experiences
that the Norman Rockwellian setting provided. She threw herself into any endeavor that her children and grandchildren
wanted to pursue. When Becky Fuller, now Rebecca Ward, was the first person from the city to win a statewide election
at Girl's State, Johnnie Mae organized a city-wide homecoming celebration complete with a parade for all the
Arkadelphia delegates that included her daughter Nancy. When Johnnie Mae's daughter Jamie wanted to pursue rodeo
and barrel racing, Nonnie perfected her ability to sew cowgirl outfits while also cheering-on her daughter from the
stands. When her daughter Linda wanted to serve as a cheerleader for Arkadelphia High School and then Ouachita
Baptist University, Johnnie Mae and Steve's house became nerve-center for all events athletic. When daughter Nancy
returned to Arkadelphia in 1964 with seven-month-old Megan to raise, Johnnie and Steve provided a nurturing, loving
home for daughter and granddaughter. Megan was the grandchild who gave Johnnie Mae her proudest title: Johnnie
Mae became ""Nonnie."
Nonnie was queen of a tribe of three generations of women known as "Spargo Girls." When her great-granddaughters
Frances and Eleanor were born in 1999, Nonnie was determined that the twin girls would not use an exclusive
communication method. Nonnie's special task was to talk with them extensively and one-on-one, making sure that the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760369 Date: 06/30/2015
girls' first desire was to talk to her. Active in Democratic politics at all levels and with a passion, she was equally a
dedicated life master of duplicate bridge and played many a set with her friends at the House of Bridge in Hot Springs.
Johnnie ultimately spent most of her time driving to wherever one of her children lived to help with whatever tasks of
life needed tending. In response to this demanding schedule, she famously responded, "You can sleep when you are
dead!" Her stock question when confronted with news from one of her children of a pending event — whether one was
receiving an award or going out for lunch — was "Well, what will you wear?" Raising all these Spargo girls, she was
expert not only at re-upholstering an entire set of living room furniture, she also sewed countless, spontaneous-yet-
appropriate attire, from couture evening gowns to cowgirl wear. Making ball gowns from the draperies was not
exclusive to other southern heroines.
Perhaps Johnnie Mae's most endearing qualities were unfailing optimism combined with great pragmatism. She lived in
the present and did not believe in guilt or regrets. Born before women could vote, she cast one of her last votes for the
woman she hoped would be the first woman President. When Hillary did not prevail, she once again enjoyed casting a
vote for a straight Democratic ticket. Nonnie would want the family to express special gratitude for the many kindnesses
extended to her by the staff and nurses at Presbyterian Village in Little Rock, where she resided since June 2009. Thank
you is extended also to Arkansas Hospice whose compassion and care comforted both family and friends. Thanks are
also expressed to the staff of Home Instead and their compassionate caregiver, Bette White. John Lee Roberts of
Arkadelphia provided unwavering help and assistance and was a much loved friend and companion to both Steve and
Johnnie Mae.
The family will have a visitation at 9:30-10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Ruggles-Wilcox Funeral Home in Arkadelphia, followed
by a graveside service at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Rose Hill Cemetery led by Father Douglas Anderson of St. James
Episcopal Church, Texarkana. Memorials may be made to Arkansas Hospice, 5600 W 12th St., Little Rock, Ark. 72204;

The teachers at Oak Hill Academy approach their jobs with the faith that even the most hardened juvenile
delinquents can achieve -- and the knowledge that many still won't
By Karen Houppert
Sunday, April 12, 2009; W18
The six teenage boys, incarcerated at the District's Oak Hill juvenile detention facility in Laurel file into their
classroom after lunch one late January afternoon. They are surprised to see strangers -- five women and two
men -- sitting in the chairs that the boys typically occupy.
The students find some empty seats and shrug out of their matching brown coats and mismatched scarves. They
are curious about the visitors in a lean-back, fold-your-arms, prove-it kind of way.
""I'm James Forman," begins a 40-something man. "I'm a professor at Georgetown Law School and -- "
"You related to the James Forman?" interrupts 17-year-old Carleto Bailey.
"I'm James Forman Jr."
"That your father? James Forman your dad?" Carleto demands.
"Yes, I "
"Wasn't he some big civil rights guy? NAACP? Or SNCC?"
"SNCC," Forman says, seemingly surprised that Carleto has heard of his father, who was executive secretary of
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for years in the 1960s before becoming active with the Black
Panthers.

"He's a good guy," Carleto continues. "You tell him that."
Forman smiles. "He passed a few years ago, but he would be happy to hear this," the professor says. He scans
the room. The Oak Hill students, all African American, are dressed identically in khaki pants and royal-blue
polo shirts. They have chosen seats on the edges of the room and, after sitting down, have pushed their chairs
back as far as possible against the wall.
Forman's Georgetown law students -- African American, Arab, Latino, Caucasian -- are in jeans and sweaters.
They lean forward, intent and maybe a little bit nervous. "I teach a class on juvenile justice at the law school,"
Forman continues. "And I thought this would be a really good way for law students to learn about juvenile
justice. There is a certain amount you can learn from reading, but you also need to see and experience things. So
I thought they would learn a lot from coming out here and hearing about your experiences."
Carleto raises an eyebrow. This is a new one.
"And the benefit for you is that they know things about the law that you don't. Ya'll have certain things you
know. They have certain things they know. It can be a learning opportunity for everybody."
Forman suggests they go around the room and share their names and an interesting fact about themselves.
Dead silence.
He smiles encouragingly. "My name is James Forman, and I helped to start this organization, See Forever, that
now runs your school," he says.
Carleto, who has been leaning back on the two rear legs of his chair, brings it down with a bang that sends his
short dreads swinging forward and his black plastic rectangular glasses sliding down his nose.
A few Georgetown students jump.
He looks out over the top of his glasses. "My name's Carleto Bailey," he says. "My interesting fact is that I'm
funny./I
He gives a wide smile of bright white teeth. The Georgetown students laugh. Oak Hill student Ashawntea
Henderson, 17, who sits next to him, rolls his eyes. But Carleto's not done: "And I'm smart."
But as it turns out, these Georgetown folks -- like his other teachers at Oak Hill Academy -- aren't going to
accept Carleto's assertion at face value. They want more than good grades, more than the right answers on a
multiple-choice test. They want him to prove that he can think.
Forman shows the group an excerpt of a film about juveniles incarcerated at New York's Rikers Island.
Afterward, the law students want to know whether a label makes a difference. It's a hard question. "Inmates?
Residents? Scholars?" one of them asks. "Does it matter what you're called?"
Carleto studies the woman's face to discern what she wants to hear back. It is blank. He struggles. "Not so
much," he says, finally. He looks at her. She seems unconvinced. He worries that he has given the wrong
answer and tries again.
"Back in the community, there are certain [police] patrols in the neighborhood who say, 'I know what you're up
to.' When we come home, some of us are trying to do right, but they basically criticize us because you're already
labeled."

"What are the labels?" Forman asks.
This one is easy for Carleto. He sinks down in his chair and throws it out.
"Trouble," he says.
***
Carleto Bailey is trouble. He is also, as he rightly noted, smart. But he has arrived at Oak Hill Academy with a
few disadvantages: He has been poorly educated in the D.C. public schools, was frequently truant and has had
multiple run-ins with the law. The D.C. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, which runs Oak Hill,
won't release information on the specific crime that landed Carleto here because he is still a juvenile, but we do
know this is Carleto's second time at the detention center. His academic knowledge is spotty at best. He can tell
you who James Forman is, but not where the comma falls in a letter's greeting. ("Dear, Fidel" he writes in a
mock letter to Castro during English class.) He is a fairly typical Oak Hill "scholar."
And, once upon a time, he would have been written off But today, staff at the fledgling Oak Hill Academy are
determined to view the kids' captive time here as a window of opportunity to fill in some of the gaping holes in
their education. Part of the reform initiative of Vincent Schiraldi, director of Youth Rehabilitation Services, the
school opened its doors only last year and takes a unique approach to teaching delinquent youth.
What would happen, Oak Hill Academy co-founders Forman and David Domenici wondered, if you seduced
these kids with content that was meaningful to them? What would happen if they had lots of good, caring
teachers in small classrooms? What if one assumed the kids could learn -- and behaved as such? In other words,
what would happen if the District's most challenged students got a private school education, albeit on a campus
of a decidedly different nature?
"The bottom line," says Domenici, "is that the kids most at risk need the highest quality programming, but
they've gotten the worst."
It is this conviction that drove Domenici, who is also the school's principal, and Forman to create three public
charter schools for underprivileged and troubled students in the District over the past 11 years. Called the Maya
Angelou schools, the two high schools and middle school attack educational deficiencies from all angles.
Students attend small classes taught by specially trained staff. The high school day stretches from 9 a.m. to 6
p.m., with three meals provided. Some kids, whose home lives prove too chaotic for study, are offered
supervised housing in the neighborhood. And it works. Last year, 93 percent of Maya Angelou graduates were
accepted into two- or four-year colleges, Domenici says. (According to the District's Office of the State
Superintendent of Education, 29 percent of students who enter ninth grade in D.C. public schools and city
charter schools enroll in postsecondary educational programs within 18 months of graduating high school.)
It is a good model. But even though Domenici and Forman were used to teaching court-involved youth -- about
40 percent of Maya Angelou students had spent some time at Oak Hill -- working inside the gates posed a new
set of challenges. Youth Rehabilitation Services has been under a court monitor for 23 years due in part to a
history of abuse and poor conditions. When Schiraldi took over the department in 2005 and began his reform
efforts by implementing a less punitive and more therapeutic detention model at Oak Hill, he saw immediately
that changing the school was essential. "How could I look at my staff at Oak Hill and say we are about
excellence when the kids were sitting in a school that was a total waste of time from 9 to 3 every day?"
Schiraldi says. Kids sat and watched movies all day. Little, if any teaching was going on, Schiraldi says. "It was
a miserable, miserable school."
Schiraldi immediately began lobbying the D.C. Board of Education hard to hire someone new to operate the
school, and as soon as he got the okay, he put out a request for proposals. Domenici and Forman submitted a
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760796 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760796 Date: 06/30/2015
plan that Schiraldi says "blew the other ones out of the water," and in 2007 were awarded a $12 million contract
to run the school for the next three years.
Domenici's and Forman's partnership is a somewhat unlikely one. Domenici is the son of former New Mexico
Republican senator Pete Domenici. He went to Stanford Law School, worked in corporate law for a few years
and then gave it up to teach and work with teen delinquents. Forman is the grandson of Jessica Mitford, who
was the daughter of a British baron and a celebrated civil rights activist and journalist. Forman, who graduated
from Yale Law School, worked as a law clerk for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and as a D.C. public defender.
After seeing how few good schooling options his teenage clients had, he joined forces with Domenici, whom he
met through a mutual friend, to start an independent school for 20 students in 1997. A year later, it became part
of the first Maya Angelou public charter school.
At Oak Hill Academy, principal Domenici fights with an occasionally maddening bureaucracy for basics:
functioning boilers, permission for a college tour for a group of six students, classes uninterrupted by
corrections staff who sometimes will call three-quarters of the students out in the middle of class to take their
meds. Forman is chairman of the Maya Angelou Public Charter School Board of Directors and board member
of its parent group, the See Forever Foundation. He attacks hurdles from the other side, fundraising and
advocating for juvenile justice reform.
"When David came out to run the school here, it was like "Ocean's 12": Go find all the people you can trust
from your previous mission," Forman jokes. That included past colleagues and even a few Maya Angelou
graduates. Samantha Crandal Simpore, who had been at a then-coed Oak Hill herself when she was 15 on an
accessory assault charge, went to a Maya Angelou school and now runs the Oak Hill Academy welcome center.
"I tell them, I was here, too," Simpore says. She tells each new student about how she was 17 years old and
didn't know her multiplication tables, how she rode the bus to school each day hooked up to her Walkman,
hoping no one knew she was listening to a recitation of times tables. "I say: 'You're at an intersection in your
life. You know what's down the street behind you. Nothing you can do about that. But you have a choice about
what's up the road ahead.'"
Many of the 90 Oak Hill students, ranging in age from 14 to 19, come in performing way below grade level, and
nearly half have been diagnosed with learning disabilities. They are at Oak Hill for an average of 10 months,
cycling in and out on a schedule that has nothing to do with a nine-month academic year. Out of necessity, they
are grouped according to the cell blocks they live on to keep opposing gangs separate. Thirteen-year-olds can be
in classes with 18-year-olds. More than half have been committed to Oak Hill for violent felonies. Fights are
common. (Before the month is out, Carleto will get into a fistfight in the hallway that will delay his release
date.)
Through the use of small classes -- typically five to 14 teens work with one teacher, a teaching assistant and a
guard -- the school organizes the curriculum around four-week themes designed to pique students' curiosity and
get them to think critically about the nature of democracy, social justiCe and their role in the world. For
example, during the Relationship theme, students parse the types of relationships ranging from those between
humans and the natural world (ancient river civilizations) to those between individuals and groups (Pharaohs
and their subjects) to those between humans and ideas (liberation theology). At the same time, in English class,
students will be working on the standard five-paragraph essay via the guiding question: "Why do relationships
matter, and how can relationships be both good and bad for people?" With the current unit, Change, the D.C.
public school system's learning standards are woven into the social studies curriculum under loose headings
such as "Changes in the Way Humans Think About the World and Their Place in It," which becomes a way of
introducing the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment and the Magna Carta. It's a philosophy that emphasizes
learning through making cross-discipline connections long popular in affluent, progressive schools but typically
eschewed in schools for underprivileged kids, where rote learning and a return to such basics often rule.

Oak Hill Academy has also created a course called Advocacy, which the Georgetown law students are co-
teaching, emphasizing this month's theme. Domenici believes learning how the law works in a democracy "is
essential to teaching them to be good citizens."
"We always believed that one of our roles should be to help kids self-advocate or advocate on behalf of a
community," Domenici says. "We think this is a good skill for students individually and also one that our
democracy demands."
But this is an ambitious agenda, and Oak Hill Academy faces significant obstacles. Can you teach teens to think
critically when they're missing the basic underpinnings of education? How do you teach empowerment in a
setting that demands rigid compliance to keep kids from misbehaving?
Although he sometimes grows discouraged, Domenici does his best to buoy his staff members when they learn
that one of their most promising students got into a fight on the unit or "graduated" from the program only to
commit another crime and be sent back. "I talk to staff about the fact that, day to day, our job is to do the
absolute best work you can in the domain that is within your control," he says, reminding them that they don't
control all the pieces of the puzzle. "And if you do that well, you have done the moral and just thing."
His staff members must keep the faith while straddling what are to them two equally potent realities: First,
knowledge is power, and through possessing it, every student is capable of success. And, absent the right
support, failure lurks right around the corner. It sounds like this: "I think Carleto has a good chance of finishing
high school and going on to college," Domenici says. Pause. "Also, he is highly at risk of not doing that."
***
It is a cold day in late January, and Oak Hill is in the midst of the four-week session on change. Dressed in
jeans, a blue shirt and a gray corduroy jacket (the heat's not working), Oak Hill social studies teacher John
Adams paces around the room and then stops to bend over Carleto, who is doodling on a piece of paper at his
desk.
"Pay attention," he says, taking Carleto's pencil. "Carleto, what is today's essential question?"
"What is historical change, and how is it different from other kinds of change?" Carleto says, reading from the
board where Adams has scrawled his topic.
"Yes," Adams says. He ignores a student who is wandering around the room aimlessly, until the student
snatches a hat off a classmate and tosses it toward the hallway. A youth development specialist, which is how
corrections guards are referred to under Schiraldi, appears to be deeply engrossed in a magazine in the back of
the room. But she snatches the hat from mid-air, scowls at the disruptive student and tucks the hat in her pocket.
"Please sit," Adams tells the student.
Not quite sitting, not quite standing, the student perches on the edge of Adams's desk.
Good enough.
Adams continues: "What's the difference between personal change and historical change?"
Silence.
"Anybody?

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760796 Date: 06/30/2015
More silence.
"Ashawntea?"
"Historical change is like a revolution," Ashawntea says.
Adams throws out a list of changes -- getting a raise in salary, moving to a new house, the election of President
Obama -- and Carleto accurately sorts the changes into micro and macro, personal and historical.
"Obama's campaign was all about change," Adams says. "Do you think he is talking historical change?" He
wants the students to think about the president, who has been in office now for two days. What might his first
100 days look like? he asks the students. "What advice would you offer him?"
Carleto looks stumped.
"Just throw out some ideas," Adams prompts. He tells the students that they are going to craft their own letters
to the president, advising him on how to set his agenda for change.
Carleto slaps his pencil down on the desk. "Obama's not reading our letters," he says. He folds his arms across
his chest, skeptical that the president will lay eyes on this letter -- and skeptical, perhaps, that the teachers really
want to hear his ideas.
***
Later, Carleto will acknowledge that he knows quite a bit about the president, as he is reading Barack Obama's
"Dreams From My Father." "It started off as a good book, but it got excellent," he says. He struggles hard to
articulate the book's themes and appeal. "I don't know how to put it," he says finally, "but growing up with -- no
disrespect, but -- a Caucasian mom and an African father, he still made it through."
Sitting in a guard's room off the gym on a February evening, the echoing sound of classmates bouncing
basketballs around the cavernous gym, Carleto goes on to tell his own possibly apocryphal story.
"As a child, he was very fun, happy -- as far as kindergarten through sixth grade. Starting in first grade, he was
on the honor roll and was also making it to school every day," he says, beginning in third person, but quickly
lapsing into first. "In the late stages of middle school; at the end of eighth grade, I started smoking weed, doing
stuff I wasn't supposed to be doing."
He takes full responsibility. "No one peer-pressured me or anything. I was liking what was going on when I was
high," he explains. He, like almost all the teens at Oak Hill, denies being involved in a gang. Still, Carleto says
that his best friend since elementary school was killed in 10th grade in "a neighborhood thing." "Nowadays,
anyone can just ride up on you, and you can be mistaken for someone else and be shot," he says, explaining that
his buddy was shot because of a "miscommunication." "It wasn't intended for us," he says, insisting that he and
his friend, nicknamed "Smoke," were just waiting for the bus. Then he announces, "I don't want to talk about
it."
So he doesn't, though it clearly haunts him: He will doodle "R.I.P. Smoke" on the cover of his blue folder or on
a piece of loose-leaf paper or the comer of the chalkboard.
He's happy to talk about Oak Hill Academy though, where he has a 3.5 grade-point average after six months.
(Domenici says Carleto is in the top 25 percent of students at Oak Hill and tests fairly high on assessments.)
Carleto likes the school even though it is a bit easy for him, being a senior in with freshman. He complains that
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760796 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760796 Date: 06/30/2015
the classes are too short and that the guards are always interrupting them to move on just when the class is
getting warmed up. That really bugs him, but he doesn't say much. He says that he will be leaving Oak Hill in
two months and intends to finish his schooling at Oak Hill's transition center in the District, from which he says
he will graduate this June. When he gets out, there are a couple of things he wants to do right off, he says. First,
he intends to see his girlfriend, then go out to a restaurant and then go to "the Adidas shop in Georgetown,
where my mom will get me some stuff-- and my dad, too."
He says his mom was pretty upset when he got arrested and sent to Oak Hill. "She was. . . I'm going to say she
was kind of like surprised at my actions, what I done," Carleto says. "You know how they say 'Whatever hides
in the dark, comes out?'. . . She was not ashamed of me, but disappointed in me." Meanwhile, she makes the
long, 45-minute trek from the District to Laurel to visit. "Every weekend, both days!" he says.
He is alternately vague and specific when he describes his family life. He has four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16
and 11 -- and reports that he and his two younger brothers live with his mom. He says his mom works as a
secretary, but he struggles to remember where. "She was working with, what's that program downtown by the
Washington Monument, dealing with Smokey the Bear?. . . I'm trying to think. It's right by the Holocaust
Museum. It's a brick building. She works there."
Later, Carleto's school case worker, Essence Jones, will offer a somewhat different account of Carleto's life.
Although Carleto is in 12th grade, he will not graduate in June as he says. He is still six credits shy, Jones says.
And it will be at least three months -- not two -- before his release.
Carleto's father is not part of his life, Jones says. The teenager had been living with his aunt before coming to
Oak Hill. His mother, who has a rap sheet dating to 1982, has been in and out of jail for years, arrested
repeatedly for a string of felonies and misdemeanors, including possession and distribution of drugs, as well as
prostitution. She has been in prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years for
assault with a dangerous weapon, attempted distribution of cocaine and violation of bail.
She is not visiting Carleto on weekends.
***
By the end of February, still in the midst of the unit on change, the Oak Hill teens file into their advocacy class,
jostling each other, edgy. It is unseasonably warm outside, and they do not want to be here. Reluctantly they
take their seats, and Carleto positions himself so that he can see the patch of brown grass and mud in the prison
yard, visible through the door someone has wedged open. Occasionally, a breeze wafts into the room.
Today, the law students decide to tackle the topic of disproportionate minority confinement. If youths of color
are 35 percent of the general population in the United States, but 62 percent of the prison population, this is
disproportionate minority confinement, the law students explain. They refer the teens to a handout each has on
the desk in front of him, an article excerpt from New American Media, "Racism of the Juvenile Justice System
Revealed," to explain that this isn't simply because people of color commit more crimes: "African-American
youths are 4.5 times more likely, and Latinos 2.3 times more likely, than white youths to be detained for
identical offenses. About half of white teenagers arrested on a drug charge go home without being formally
charged and drawn into the system. Only one-quarter of black teens arrested on drug charges catch a similar
break."
Although youth of color are 100 percent of Oak Hill's population of inmates and, indeed, 100 percent of all 721
juvenile delinquents currently committed to Youth Rehabilitation Services care in settings across the city,
disproportionate minority confinement is a hard concept for the teens to grasp. Georgetown student Abby Fee
tries a pie graph, a bar graph, a sketch of disproportionate Xs and Os. Blank stares.

Then it slowly dawns on Ashawntea what they're talking about. "Hey," he says, suddenly sitting forward.
"They're switched around! Basically, there's more of us juveniles in prison than white juveniles -- even though
there's more of them."
"Yes," Fee says. "So the population outside the system looks a lot different from that inside the system."
Ashavvntea sits back in his chair to mull this over.
Fee and the other law students move the teens from the statistics to a speculative discussion about the reasons
behind these figures. They have prepared a role-playing game to coax the teens into thinking about this from
different perspectives. Then, they want the students to practice advocating for change. "So, we're going to have
three roles," Fee says, dividing the teens into pairs. "One group is a 15-year-old; one group is playing a math
teacher; and one group is playing a city council member."
Carleto and his partner learn that they are to play a city council member who is preparing a presentation on
reforming the police department. Carleto doesn't want to be a city council member. He doesn't even want to be
here today. He wraps and unwraps his pencil in the bottom of his T-shirt. He puts his glasses on, then takes
them off.
"How could you maintain better relationships" with police? Fee asks, settling herself into a chair to help Carleto
and his partner work through this.
Carleto throws his pencil down on the table. Won't answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, he offers a sullen
challenge. "Stop harassing people for no reason?"
"How do you want them to treat people?"
"Equally," he says. He picks up the pencil and tap, tat, taps it on the desk. Fee tries to get him to be more
specific.
"Don't arrest for small problems. Instead, take them home, and tell your family what you're doing," Carleto's
partner says, unconsciously slipping into second person.
"And how do you think they can help crime be stopped or decreased in general?" Fee prods.
A long pause. Could be their minds are whirring busily; could be they're spacing out. Fee, a teacher before
enrolling at Georgetown, takes it in stride. She taps the paper a couple of times and repeats the question.
"Don't have 10 or 15 cars patrolling and then have an area where you barely see a police car," Carleto says.
"Patrol each ward equally?" asks Fee.
Carleto writes that down, then adds: "I see a lot of cruel things they done that ain't right." Fee nods, encourages
him to write it down.
Carleto's partner grabs the pencil and speaks as he writes. "The majority of police shouldn't carry guns. I could
say, 'The majority of police are racist.'"
"But how would you fix that?" Fee. prods.

"A camera on their car to catch them if they're doing it -- but a secret one," Carleto suggests. He sits up
straighter in his chair. "And don't just pull over people because they're black. They can say anything, that's the
reason why I pulled you over, because your headlights are off or whatever." Suddenly, Carleto is on a roll, and
he rattles off a list of improvements.
"Call to order of the city council," says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi.
Carleto and his partner stand in the front of the class. "Hello, I'm Mr. Jones, and I am a city councilman,"
Carleto says, glancing down at his paper and twisting the tail of his shirt with his free hand. "We have some
complaints from the different communities and wards about police, and these are some of our suggestions about
cracking down on officers." He sounds nervous as he begins the list. "Stop harassing minorities and other ethnic
youths, and treat them equal to the same race that you are. Also, police don't arrest if there is a situation at the
school like a fight or anything. I feel they should not be arrested but taken home. Then tell their parents why
this happened and what the reason was for being stopped by the police." He moves briskly through the
suggestions and twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact with the audience. In conclusion, he says,
"verbally abusing" youth won't be tolerated any more. "Basically, we want to crack down on the officers and
have them removed, if so."
Another pair of students rises to begin a presentation, but the teens are interrupted by the crackle of a guard's
walkie-talkie. "Time to go!" the guard announces.
The law students are surprised -- they are not quite done -- but politely acquiesce.
"Wait!" Ashawntea says, standing up. "We got 10 more minutes."
"It will take you five minutes to get your stuff together and get your coats on," the guard says.
"But we have 10 minutes!" Carleto insists. He and Ashawntea sit back down and fold their arms. "It's only 2:20.
We got 10 more minutes still."
The guard takes a beat, then shrugs and concedes Carleto's point. He goes back out into the hall to wait.
Carleto shoots Ashawntea a look of surprise. His advocacy worked.
"Yesss!" Ashawntea hisses under his breath.

Thanks, Hillary. I'm attaching the CV of and have also sent it to Jake. I'd have loved to attend the B6
India lunch, but I've got a long-standing working lunch with the ""Managing Global Insecurity" project at Brookings that
Carlos Pascual set up and has been leading. Tom Pickering, Tim Wirth, Chet Crocker, Esther Brimmer, and various other
such will be there, and I can't pull out (my office had passed this word to yours). I'm so pleased you're going to India. It
was your trip to the region, with Chelsea, in 95 that established the momentum for Bill's. I'll always remember you talk
(with slide show) at State after you returned. I'll send you tomorrow my book "Engaging India" now thatyou're re-
engaging them. Hard work ahead of on non-pro, as you know. Hope to see you before long. I'm taking to Italy B6
and Turkey for two weeks next Saturday. Warmest regards, Strobe

That is a huge group. There is no way to make them all feel important and listened to. Should we split group in half and

his predecessors were willing to do all of those
thing—and indeed DID all of those things. It's the

Comment EST25]: This is an important change:
alas, America has emphatically and all too often
NOT been all those good things. We were too often
acting on the priniple that the enemy of our enemy
was our friend, even if that friend was dictatorial—
"our son of a bitch." So this needs to be put in terms
of a promise end of more principled application of a
principle that was honored in the breach in the past.

for it. Bush43 made this concept his own, put his

Comment[5130]:I would plea for avoiding
"multi-polar." It's a Euro-cliche now gone
universal, but it's not really valid analytically, nor is
it smart to use it, precisely because it does echo the
rhetoric of those who want to see America be "just
another country." Sorry this costs the speech the
"multi-polar"/ "multi-partner" line, but I really think
it's important to remove multipolar from the
vocabulary of the adminisfration. Happy to
elaborate.

Quick note to tell you the meeting ended today after lunch and it turned out to be a very positive event. To a person, the
heads of delegation were hugely complimentary. Good, very candid — even ""frank" as the diplomats say -- level of
engagement, a lot of positive feeling and trust built up, an eagerness for this group to continue engaging and — perhaps —
make some progress. Dan Reifsnyder, an OES DAS who's been here a long time, said it was best meeting of this kind he
has seen in 20 years.
Issues still damnably difficult, but a pretty palpable sense in the room that something good had happened. Hearty
congrats from the Chinese, UK, Japanese, Aussies, EU, Danes, Swedes, South Africans, etc. Mike Froman did an
excellent job as Chair (I was head of U.S. delegation), and Steve Chu and John Holdren did very useful presentations
yesterday. Heads of delegation met with President in Blue Room for a reception late yesterday afternoon, which went
over big. Mike and I met with President in Oval beforehand. Reception at Kennedy Center in evening for whole
delegations, plus people from Hill, NG0s, etc., yesterday. Sen. Kerry spoke.
We followed up with a long bilateral with China and then a private dinner with the UK. More bilats tomorrow. Next
meeting of the Forum May 25-26 in Paris.
Many thanks to HRC for kicking it off in style.

Colleagues,
Ambassador Llorens provided a readout of CODEL Mack's trip to Honduras. During the weekend trip, U.S.
Representatives Mack and Bilbray met with several Honduran officials, including Micheletti, the Supreme Court
president, and six presidential candidates. It is Ambassador Llorens' opinion the CODEL was not helpful to the Obama
Administration's goals in Honduras. The CODEL already has departed and is en route back to the United States.
Thank you,

ALL: We've spent the better part of the weekend with CODEL Mack (Rep. Mack and Rep. Bilbray). Prior to their arrival
announcement on Friday, Mack staffers had already made a number of appointments on their own. However, the
Embassy provided full logistical support and security, and set up a number of other appointinents where it was
appropriate for Embassy officials to participate consistent with our non-contact policy. The CODEL arrived at mid-day
yesterday. I hosted a country team briefing over lunch at the Residence. They made clear that they were in strong
disagreement with many aspect of our (Administration) policy on Honduras, but they did hear us out on our perspective
on the situation since the coup. Following the country team briefing, the CODEL went to the Presidential Palace to meet
with de facto regime President Micheletti. No Embassy staff was present or involved in that meeting, although we
provided the CODEL with security and transportation. Following the 90-minute session with M, the CODEL returned to
the Residence and met with Supreme Court President Rivera and several of the court magistrates. The Rivera discussed
his views on the legal aspects of the coup. He made the case that the process involving the Attorney General and the
Supreme Court was legal, although he acknowledged that by extraditing President Zelaya the military had disregarded
Court instructions and its issuance of an arrest warrant. The Honduran court members found a very receptive CODEL to
their arguments. The CODEL then stayed at the Residence for a meeting with a group of legislators. We had five
members of the Honduran National Congress representing three political parties. Three of the members were
supportive of Micheletti and two were strongly opposed to the coup. In a very interesting debate, former Minister of
Defense Orellana (a Liberal Congressmen who resigned following the coup) won the debate making a very powerful
presentation arguing that the events of June 28 were unquestionably a coup. Orellana's arguments for very muck track
with ours, and I believe this meeting had an impact on both Rep. Mack and Rep. Bilbray views about the coup. I am
convinced they came out of this meeting much more aware of the serious legal flaws in the regime's case that the coup
was constitutional.
The CODEL returned to their hotel where they met with a group of U.S. and Honduran business leaders to discuss the
current situation. We were not asked to participate in this event. The CODEL returned this morning to the Residence
for a breakfast I hosted with six of the country's presidential candidates. This was a an interesting session and allowed
for a review of the political situation and a look at possible ways forward. In the meeting Bilbray laid out the CODEL's
perspectives and the message they planned to take back to the Hill and to the Administration. Both stated that they
supported the idea of a negotiated solution under the Arias mediation. However, they said they would advocate an
agreement that would call for Micheletti's resignation, but not the restitution of Z. The CODEL's proposal was for some
type of constitutional succession involving the President of the Supreme Court as Micheletti's successor. Following this
meeting, the CODEL met with Pastor Anderson, a U.S. religious and social worker here. He was accompanied by several
Honduran human rights workers who made a cogent case that the human rights situation in Honduras had deteriorated
significantly since the June 28 coup.
The CODEL left for the airport about an hour ago. This CODEL was friendly and professional, but they certainly were not
helpful to Administration policy goals in Honduras. The CODEL sent a strong message of support for the Micheletti
regime. The meeting of the CODEL with Micheletti received prominent press coverage by the establishment media,
which are mostly in the anti-Zelaya camp.
As usual, our staff did a splendid job handling all aspects of this short fused visit. We will report the details of the CODEL
via front channel message.

SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
REMARKS AT THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION
WASHINGTON, DC
SEPTEMBER 18, 2009
I appreciate the opportunity to join you on the eve of the United Nations
General Assembly and to outline some key issues that the Obama
Administration will focus on in New York and in the weeks and months
ahead.
Let me begin, though, by echoing the President's statement yesterday
that he has approved the recommendations of the Pentagon and his entire
national security team to deploy a stronger and more comprehensive
missile defense system in Europe. This decision came after a lengthy
and in-depth review of our assessment of the threat posed by Iran's
ballistic missile program, and the technology that we have to confront it.
And it is a decision that will leave America stronger, and more capable
of defending our troops, our interests, and our Allies.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Let's be clear about what this new system will do relative to the previous
program — which was many years from being deployed. With the
President's decision, we will deploy missile defense sooner than the
previous program, so that we will be able to swiftly counter the threat
posed by Iran's short and medium-range ballistic missiles.
We will deploy missile defense that is more comprehensive than the
previous program, with more interceptors in more places, and a better
capacity to protect all of our friends and allies in the region. We will
deploy technology that is actually proven so that we do not waste time or
taxpayer money, and we will preserve the flexibility to adjust our
approach to the threat as it evolves.
So make no mistake: if you support missile defense, then this is a
stronger and smarter approach than the previous program. It does what
missile defense is actually supposed to do — it defends America and our
Allies.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Now I know we have heard criticism of this plan from some quarters.
But much of it is not connected to facts. We are not ""shelving" missile
defense, we are deploying missile defense sooner than the Bush
Administration planned to, and we are deploying a more comprehensive
system. We are not reducing our capacity to protect our interests and our
Allies from Iran, we are increasing that capacity and focusing it on our
understanding of Iran's capabilities. And most of all, we would never
walk away from our Allies — instead, we are deploying a system that
enhances their security, that advances our cooperation with NATO, and
that actually places more resources in more countries.
Two of those Allies are Poland and the Czech Republic, and we deeply
appreciate their willingness to host parts of the previously planned
system. We will continue to cooperate closely with both nations — for
instance, through rotation of a Patriot battery in Poland, and close
missile defense research and development work with Czech companies.
As we explore land based interceptors going forward, we have made it
clear that those two,countries will be at the top of the list. And let me
underscore that we are bound together by our common commitment as
NATO Allies, and also by deep historical, economic, and cultural ties
that will never be broken.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Finally, let me reiterate what the President said yesterday: this decision
was not about Russia; it was about Iran and the threat that its ballistic
missile programs continue to pose. And because of this decision, we will
be in a far stronger position to deal with that threat, and to do so with
technology that works.
My main reason for being here today is to give you a review of our
agenda next week in New York. Before I get to specifics, though, I want
to share a quick story. A few days ago, a friend, knowing I was heading
to the UN General Assembly, gave me a cartoon from The New Yorker.
It showed a delegate in his seat at the United Nations passing a note to
the delegate next to him. And the caption read: "Shhh. It's a birthday
card for Lichtenstein. Sign it and pass it on."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Well, comic relief is essential in our line of work. But as with most
humor, this cartoon is also commentary. And it represents one view of
the United Nations — a caricature of what multilateral organizations
spend their time doing.
As President Obama leads our US delegation at this year's General
Assembly, I hope we can demonstrate that the United Nations does not
have to be just a diplomatic talk shop on Pt Avenue.
At its best, it can be an institution that brings the world's nations
together to solve global problems through adherence to rules and
principles set forth in the UN Charter. And it is the responsibility of the
192 member nations — during the General Assembly and beyond -- to
capitalize on the opportunity for global cooperation and progress that the
UN affords.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
I outlined earlier this summer at the Council on Foreign Relations the
Obama Administration's efforts to advance our interests and solve
today's problems through a global architecture of cooperation.
We must begin by taking responsibility ourselves — something that under
President Obama we have already begun to do on issues from climate
change to non-proliferation. And we have called on others to do the
same.
By building and strengthening partnerships, institutions, and
international regimes, we can forge a global consensus and use that
leverage to offer clear incentives to all nations to cooperate and live up
to their responsibilities, and strong disincentives to act in isolation or
provoke conflict. The United Nations and this month's General
Assembly offer a venue and a forum for nations to work together to live
up to the founding charter and abide by and enforce international rules in
service of global peace and security.

This is not only critical to the effectiveness of global institutions; it is
essential to meeting the global challenges of the 21' century. This is
what Strobe describes as "The Great Experiment" — and I believe it is
the heart of America's mission in the world today.
Few issues reflect the need for a global architecture of cooperation more
than nuclear non-proliferation. No issue poses a more serious threat to
our security or the world's, and it will be a main topic of discussion next
week and beyond.
The President outlined a robust and ambitious arms control and
nonproliferation agenda in Prague earlier this year that can move us
toward a world without nuclear weapons.
As the President said, this won't be easy. It might not even happen in
our lifetimes. And, as long as nuclear weapons exist in the world, the
United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective deterrent
capability.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Next week, the President will chair a meeting of the U.N. Security
Council on nonproliferation and disarmament. He will emphasize the
importance of strengthening the international nuclear nonproliferation
regime — and the critical role the Council must play in enforcing
compliance with nonproliferation obligations.
The President also has asked me to lead the U.S. delegation to a
conference on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and this will be the
first time a Secretary of State has attended. It will give me the
opportunity to underscore the importance of the CTBT to the global
nonproliferation effort and to broader U.S. security interests.
Strengthening the non-proliferation regime means working to bring
other nations into compliance. This includes North Korea and Iran. Let
me take a moment to speak about Iran, another key topic on my agenda
next week.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
To begin, it is important to recall what's really at issue, and what's really
at stake.
Iran has refused for years to address the international community's deep
concerns about its nuclear program, underscored repeatedly by the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the UN Security Council.
Iran's continued failure to live up to its obligations carries profound
consequences — for the security of the United States and our allies; for
progress on global non-proliferation and progress towards disarmament;
for the credibility of the Security Council and the Non-Proliferation
Treaty; and for stability in the Middle East and beyond.
Our concern is not Iran's right to develop peaceful nuclear energy, but
its responsibility to demonstrate that its program is intended exclusively
for peaceful purposes. This is not hard to do. Iran's continued refusal to
cooperate has damaged the credibility of its claim that it does not seek a
nuclear weapon.
9

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Iran faces a choice. The international community has made abundantly
clear what is possible for all Iranians if Iran lives up to its
responsibilities on the nuclear issue — the benefits of economic
connections to the rest of the world, cooperation on peaceful nuclear
energy, and partnership in education and science.
But there will be accompanying costs for Iran's continued defiance -
more isolation and economic pressure, and less possibility of progress
for the people of Iran.
The Obama Administration has clearly conveyed our readiness to
engage directly with Iran. We know that dialogue doesn't guarantee
success. But we also know that our past refusal to engage yielded no
progress on the nuclear issue, nor did it stem Iran's support for terrorist
groups.
Over the past eight months, the President has reached out both to the
Iranian government and people. We have made clear our desire to
resolve issues with Iran diplomatically. Iran must now decide whether
to join us in this effort.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Yet, since June, we have seen the Iranian government engaged in a
mockery of the justice system, including show trials, and suppression of
free speech. The Iranian government seeks a sense of justice in the
world, but stands in the way of the justice it seeks.
Nonetheless, we remain ready to engage with Iran — not as an end in
itself, but as a means of addressing the growing concerns that we and
our international partners have about Iran's actions, especially on the
nuclear issue. In New York next week, I will meet with my counterparts
from the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany to
discuss the way forward and prepare for talks that the European Union's
Javier Solana is arranging at the beginning of October.
Our message will be clear: We are serious. We will soon see if the
Iranians are serious. This is not about process for the sake of process. In
New York, we will work with our partners to put Iran's choice into
focus and to stress that engagement must produce real results and that
we have no appetite for talk without action.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Let me also highlight a few other issues that I will be addressing at the
General Assembly and in the months ahead: Iraq, Afghanistan and
Pakistan; development; and women.
Iraq has made important strides with the support of the United States and
the international community to build a more secure and hopeful future
for its people. We look forward to the parliamentary election next
January as an important milestone in this journey, and pledge to work
with Iraqis and the international community, including the invaluable
UN Mission to Iraq, to make these elections a success.
As a result of our common efforts, our relationship with Iraq can now
enter into a period of transition as our military draws down and the role
of civilian agencies increases to better meet the needs of the future and
ensure a stable, sovereign and independent Iraq that contributes to peace
and security in the Middle East. This reflects no lessening of our
commitment — on the contrary, it demonstrates that we have entered a
new, sustained and more mature partnership that will serve both of
countries far into the future. I'm pleased that Vice President Biden,
accompanied by my Deputy Jim Steinberg, recently returned to Iraq to
continue our robust engagement with Iraq's leaders.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
The partnership between our countries will continue to build security
cooperation while strengthening diplomatic relations and building
stronger ties in commerce, rule of law, education, science and culture
through our Strategic Framework Agreement coordinating committee, a
session of which Prime Minister Maliki and I co-chaired in July. [We'll
seek to hold another session in the coming months].
Also on my docket for the General Assembly will be meetings related to
Afghanistan and Pakistan. President Obama has stated our core goal: to
disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately defeat al-Qaida and its extremist
allies, and to prevent their return to either country. This is a goal we
share with Afghanistan, with Pakistan and with the international
community. In fact, pursuing al-Qaida and the Taliban was the basis of
the original UN resolutions that authorized U.S. military action after the
September 1 1 th attacks and created ISAF, the International Security
Assistance Force of 42 nations helping Afghans secure their country.
13
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Our long-term security, and that of our friends around the world, is
connected to the security and well-being of the people of Afghanistan
and Pakistan. To effectively squeeze the extremists fighting to
destabilize both countries, the Afghan and Pakistani governments must
be better able to secure their territory from extremists and meet the basic
needs of their populations.
The recent Afghan elections at once illustrate the promise and the
challenges of Afghanistan. Alongside our partners and the UN, we will
continue to encourage all parties to respect the international and Afghan
electoral institutions charged with determining the final outcome of the
election process. When the next president is inaugurated, we will work
to step up the level of international engagement with the new
government in a strong partnership to strengthen governance at all
levels.
As we address these urgent challenges, we will also work on other issues
that have implications for American security and interests. Following up
on my trip to Africa last month, and the President's visit to Ghana earlier
in the year, he will host a lunch for leaders of sub-Saharan Africa during
the General Assembly. I will meet with Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias to continue our joint efforts to resolve the crisis in Honduras and

help that country restore the democratic constitutional order. I will also
be meeting with donors and other stakeholders committed to helping
Haiti respond to the economic dislocation caused by the global
economic crisis and the hurricane. And I will continue discussions with
our allies and other partners in Asia about the situation in Burma.
If the global architecture of cooperation demands responsibility of us
and our partners, it also offers opportunities. Just as we are focusing
intensively on urgent challenges like Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan and
Pakistan, so too are we pursuing a positive agenda devoted to expanding
opportunity so that more people in more places can fulfill their dreams
and live up to their God-given potential. And I will focus considerable
attention on two areas of opportunity — development and women.
Many of you have heard me describe our plans to integrate diplomacy
and development as two of the three pillars of our foreign policy, along
with defense.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
I have talked in different venues about the Obama Administration's
commitment to leading with diplomacy and engaging other nations --
with and beyond government. Next week, I will outline how we will
approach development in tandem with our diplomacy — to be effective
and efficient and enable the State Department, USAID, and the
Millennium Challenge Corporation to pursue and execute 21st century
foreign policy goals.
The foundation for our approach will be principles that will move us
away from top-down assistance that too often fails to meet the needs of
those we are attempting to help, or has only short-term effect. To solve
the complex problems of today's world — where issues like poverty,
hunger, health, and climate change intersect — we want to focus on root
causes, and on country-driven efforts that are comprehensive, last over
time, leverage existing multi-lateral institutions and foster new
partnerships, and coordinate donors and stakeholders strategically.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
I will have the chance to detail this approach during my stay in New
York, and I also look forward to highlighting these issues when I
participate in an event that the UN Secretary General will host on food
security.
To successfully integrate our diplomacy and development goals at the
State Department and USAID, we have launched a Quadrennial
Diplomacy and Development Review — and, I regret to say that, in so
doing, we have added another acronym to the State lexicon: QDDR.
The QDDR, led by Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew, is a broad
examination of our structure, policies, and budget, and will lead to better
accountability and measurable results throughout the department.
Finally, our delegation, and I personally, will work to advance
international efforts to recognize women as key drivers of economic
progress and social stability, as well as to address impediments to
women's empowerment and advancement, particularly sexual and
gender-based violence.
17

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
I will chair a session of the Security Council and will speak on behalf of
the adoption of a resolution on "women, peace and security" which will
endorse concrete measures to implement Security Council Resolution
1820 and address sexual and gender-based violence as a tactic of war.
I saw the scale of misery caused by this violence on my recent trip to the
Democratic Republic of Congo, where I met with rape survivors as well
as those trying to assist them.
Next week, I will be speaking with other foreign ministers and heads of
state about strategies to end this violence and to ensure that those who
commit atrocities are prosecuted and not treated with impunity.
I will also work with women leaders at the General Assembly to
highlight the importance of raising the status of girls and women and
investing in their potential — through education, economic development,
and health care. If women are free from violence, and accorded their
rights, they can contribute to their local economies and become change
agents generating greater prosperity and stability for their families,
communities, and societies as a whole.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Every day, I go to work at the State Department and am reminded that
the world has given us no shortage of urgent crises or long-range
challenges. Our agenda is full and it is ambitious — from Northeast Asia
to sub-Saharan Africa to Europe and the Americas. And we will remain
vigilant and pro-active about all of the issues, even as our plate seems to
get fuller by the day. And I will be relying on all of you to share your
expertise and advice in helping us do our jobs as well as we can to serve
our nation and the American people.
At this time of year, as we contemplate the agenda at the UN next week,
and what the world will hold in the months and years beyond, it seems
appropriate to think of new beginnings. Not only because the nations of
the world are about to meet — which is an opportunity -- but because we
are also celebrating the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the Jewish
High Holy Days.
It is a time of reflection and renewal for hundreds of millions of our
fellow citizens around the globe. A time when we can borrow from all of
the world's great faiths to take stock, re-assess, and re-commit ourselves
to the values and ideals that move us forward. And it is in that spirit that
I am approaching the General Assembly and the months ahead.

Dear Hillary,
I very much hope we have a chance to spend some time with you next week for the ""Sanya Initiatove" in DC with four

our "complementary engagement" program, which I briefly mentioned to you.
I understand our offices are working on the schedules, but nothing is firm yet.
Your personal involvement with this group - perhaps a small lunch - would be a very important message seen at the
highest levels of the Chinese government and the Central Military Commission.
I'd be personally grateful not only on behalf of our group, but also on behalf of a cause that I believe will be a part of
leading to a trusting relationship between our militaries so that we will have friends in China - not enemies.

and importance every year. Attendence at the lunch alone was over 950 people including Secretary Vilsack and
ministers from many countries. She specifically complemented Secretary Clinton's role in the Sept 26 UN event. Nooyi
used much of her address challenging the private sector to do their part in carrying out the strategy unveiled in New
York.
Secretary Vilsack gave a very powerful address that focused on our efforts feed hungry children and the need to do
more. He refered to working with Secretary Clinton or to ""under Secretary Clinton's leadership" at least 3 times. It was
very well done.

Vilsack told a powerful story about going to a school feeding program while he was in kenya in august for agoa. At lunch
time, he spooned usg donated porrage into the kids red cups. After lunch he asked the kids what their favorate part of
school was. He expected to hear ""recess" or maybe reading. Instead every single child responded with "lunch - because
it is the only meal I get everyday". Vilsack was glad for what we were doing, but the event made him realize how much
more there is to do.

Subject: S Afghanistan mtg Paris
As some of you know, at lunch with Kouchner in Zurich, S agreed in principle to go to Paris for an informal
meeting of some key European players on Afghanistan (on Nov. 8 on the way to Berlin).
Welcome thoughts. I expect to hear further from French today what specifically they have in mind. She could
still go to Paris, but perhaps better not to let them do the Afpak meeting.

Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as 'special
relationship' sinks to new low
Gordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama
during his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release of
the Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left ""the special relationship"
at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.
By Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New York
Published: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009
British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy
change in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources.
But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing
on his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York
kitchen.
The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point
since John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.
It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite the
President hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed that
this was not unusual.
However, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown had
been a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.
"It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone," the source said.
"There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off."
The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on
supplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.
As a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, according to a senior
source. However, the meeting never happened.
The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would
"spend all day Friday together." However, Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of world
leaders.
The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind the
new chill in relations between Washington and London.
Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.
Downing Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.
Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.

Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, families
of victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made
speeches.
Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal
discussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The
15-minute "walk and chat" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in
Manhattan.
No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate "bilateral"
meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting
with Mr Obama.
In a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must "move in a new direction" and "embrace20a
new era of engagement". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on
relations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poor
relationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who enjoyed close
friendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.
John Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major had
tried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton's
student past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied.
Mr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for
96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.
Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled to
New York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of
justice for victims families.
The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order
to safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.
Shirin Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y than
human rights.
Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guests
paid $1,000 to attend the function attended by, among others, Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono.

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The ""surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick
up on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed
information about Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of
things that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and
much more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as "and this day, and the next day" as My Life,
it does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that
there appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore,
WJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC
quotes was far fewer than I had expected.
HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with
Branch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the
Gephardt comment, and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought
that there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much
aligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in
the book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion
of the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his
connection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are
strikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not
appear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life,
one theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages
about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you
would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his
chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch
could write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends,
later quashed, who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does
portray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks
Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from
Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye, such
as WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764995 Date: 07/31/2015
Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no
other lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason
he didn't mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if
she was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a
very small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this
before. (This is addressed more fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship
with Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with
Janet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues
are discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed
in a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her
relationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.
On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans,
China, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about
Haiti is about Branch's own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion
about North Korea, but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in
what seems to track mention of him in My Life, which seems to have more detail and background than this
book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the
USSS cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets
would be lined with "assassins." There are candid looks at WJC's take on certain people and the relationship
between some, such as Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's
drinking, such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders
going, but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's
Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained
interpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Life
only mentions Lee's accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from
Branch's book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
➢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security
agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his
personal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown,
solitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to
China or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their
treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him more
than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
➢ While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret, uncharged
and untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without
foreseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the
legal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his
dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extreme
detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American. We accept guilty
people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.' [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could
send her to jail, as she had denied it.
➢ "Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of
the affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could
have turned him into a witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while
original, struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his
steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.
➢ There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he
complained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to
say "it was interesting, in fact, that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His
visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet, announcing gladly that his worries were over because
the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's
dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched,
speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered that
his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,'
Hillary repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life.'
[Branch, 179]
HRC and gay/lesbian

Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WJC's counsel got very "exercised." WJC left
the room. "He was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life
than Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues
were even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take.
On the other hand, personal experience could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with
Moynihan. For example:
> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could
fight for themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a
freebie for him,' snapped Clinton, 'and he knows it.'" [p.140]
> In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan
for aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]
➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a
number of them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was
sure they had nothing to hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan
skated blithely on the surface, never produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny
himself for five minutes, living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania
Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182]
➢ "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted
hypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, "He doesn't understand...that he's
conceding the principles." WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press
and said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption about
Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several
examples follow:
➢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the
Clintons, with the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was a
delicate race between Hussein's failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president
said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders, water
disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, and so on. Hussein
gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch, 170]
> South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule was far more
demanding than ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden
women." [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast with
a superficial American press, which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in
exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements for
citizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds to
a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, "she [HRC] played the traditional role of First
Lady as wife and mother...") [Branch, 246]

depicted the "harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the
rave reviews of HRC's speech. [Branch, 289]
➢ Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed from
urgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact
with her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs
gratitude, but the fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.
➢ "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called
Chelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was
another story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in
American politics. He did not know everything involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much
her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all, and if she needed to counsel,
rage, or pray, he was always available." [Branch, 497]
Tension with Janet Reno
Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative
opinion of Janet Reno.
> "He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney
general. If he removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996
campaign finance] would fall to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's
wholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become a
target...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would touch off a firestorm of protest
like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.
That was not an option." [Branch, 388-389]
> Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and
continuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.
Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her
"desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't
hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'" [Branch,
398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements including
coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater,
but that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno
had failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension
the entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her
more naïve than upright, and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch, 399] He cites
that Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire second
term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764995 Date: 07/31/2015
There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to
North Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be
on the front lines.
North Korea:
➢ "On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore,
and Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme
isolation... Sure enough, Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, who proposed to allow
inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.
The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official, adding
gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters,
and he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt.' [Branch,
162]
Haiti:
➢ After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with
Gore (who said Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to
Haiti to seek a truce with the junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis'
(arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States' best interest). He
didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea, Carter again, Carter went to
the press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and Carter, invited to stay
over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the next
morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not
right...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent
negotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to
Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton
found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference, he
allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he had earned the right to
speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the United States
government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-
resident." [Branch, 200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
➢ "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and
Bush. 'Dole will support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he
doesn't have much positive to say." [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places
where he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the
seemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.
➢ On page 92 Branch writes, "No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as
alleged, but to improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser
Tony Lake, boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les
Aspin." [Branch, 92]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764995 Date: 07/31/2015
➢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also
having Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other
nations were offended that Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to
redeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC
"pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.
`Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Gore
erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and were still
wrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]
➢ On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as
a team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.
➢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second
criminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is
about a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.
The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
➢ On Gore's announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his
kickoff events—once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were
technical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself
from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House.
The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.'
First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third, Gore would be
badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'" [Branch, 553-554]
Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his
campaign. "On tape, the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to
Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood, precisely
how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him off
substance." [Branch, 554]
➢ WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not
succeeding him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart,
experience, and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential
character over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," but Clinton discounted
this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also was
perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence, which called for Gore to
emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a brooding
quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature
failed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch, 599]
➢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe
me, said the president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had
it not been for the vice president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who
would be a bright spot to run with, perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into
great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though she would never get chosen. How much of this
was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
➢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be running
essentially for a third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764995 Date: 07/31/2015
tarnish them with Clinton's character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate
that had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch.
➢ Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in one
of their stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he
meant good on the policy, and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend
the two. Gore said he had to think about it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He
had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehow
without seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch, 623-624]
➢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure
at first about recording the details. At the outset it says, "For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did
he blame Clinton for his defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him
did." [Branch, 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the
White House. Then he says, "'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,'"
Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your message,
now that we're being honest.'" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that
"Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an "unparalleled" vice
president, but that he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was
"surreal."
o Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising
scandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal
integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore said
he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered telling the president that
he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for
trouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the
ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought
he was in Neverland,' he said." [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported
Clinton all through the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself
disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did
not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little to
say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake.
He had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.
Well, he said, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double
take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both of
them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so significant
here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed
honesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..." [Branch,
644-45]
Other
➢ Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking
Maggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. "Williams was shrewd, discreet,
and efficient." [Branch, 161]

> HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's
suggestion to invade Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the
pressure, the lack of options, and his sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign
policy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake,
Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray
Inman as defense secretary." [Branch, 189]
> ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book.
Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn.
HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft
chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as a
ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a female
veterinarian of Socks' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House." [Branch,
342-343]
> Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had
subpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were
there. This included "some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed the
subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]
➢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, "In our
glancing associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as
lighthearted or recreational." [Branch, 495]
> Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their
best chance to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, tut I don't think Al
would ever do it.'" [Branch, 540]
> WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting
HRC if she decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the
two events are unconnected. "When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the
New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..."
[Branch, 557]
➢ On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because "of hard
intelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses
the cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.
DI 'Gephardt is an asshole," Hillary commented. The president, pointing to my recorders, advised gently that the tapes were on. She
winced but shrugged with a smile. "Well, he is," she insisted. In an awkward silence, I backed up both machines to erase the first
lady's epithet." [Branch, 263]

• ARKADELPHIA — Johnnie Mae Walker Spargo was born on the first day of Spring, March 20, 1919, and from that
day until her last on this earth, Nov. 8, 2009, she cast her beautiful blue eyes and dimpled smile on all of those around
her.
Johnnie Mae was the youngest daughter of Garland Lee and Hettie Mann Walker of Red Oak, Arkansas, now part of Hot
Springs on the southeast shores of Lake Hamilton. She was predeceased by her parents and siblings, Claude, Eddie,
Grady, Hansel, Clara, Isli, and Doyle. She was predeceased by her loving husband of 67 years, Stephen Fowler Spargo,
and by Jamie and Billy Gibbs, her daughter and sonin-law, and her son-in-law Allen Brown DeLamar. The Spargos, natives
of Hot Springs, made Arkadelphia home when Steve joined Reynolds Aluminum Company in 1954.
Mrs. Spargo is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Byron and Mary Lynda Spargo, of Baton Rouge, La., and her
daughters, Nancy Spargo DeLamar, of Little Rock, and Dr. Linda Spargo, of Oxford, Miss. Her grandchildren include
Megan DeLamar Schroeder and her husband, Trey, of Texarkana; Hattie Alton of Oxford, Miss.; Johni Beth Gibbs and her
fiance Jeremy Teague of Sheridan; Gwendy Clingman and her husband, Ed, of Mechanicsville, Va.; and Leslie Spargo of
Baton Rouge. Johnnie Mae was especially proud of her great-grandchildren: Frances and Eleanor Schroeder and Ryan
and Lauren Clingman.
She was a fierce and loyal advocate for each and every one of her offspring and truly believed that they could be
anything in the world they wanted to be. She was a member of the First Methodist Church in Arkadelphia. Johnnie Mae
was a pre-school teacher for many years at Margo Nelson's Wonderland School in Arkadelphia. She also helped her
community as a constant and reliable election poll worker. Even though Johnnie Mae was determined that she not be
perceived as a retiring little granny, her family was her universe. She was a strong, vibrant woman with black hair coiffed
on top of her head and clicking high heels, and she had beautiful skin that all of her progeny hope to inherit. She
believed in living to the fullest until the end, doing good works, helping all whom she encountered in ways that she
could, and imbuing her children and grandchildren with a strong work ethic and deep empathy for those less fortunate.
Many people in Arkansas have been the recipient of one of her lemon butter pound cakes for doing something kind for
one of her girls. When she won the 2003 Clark County Democrat of the Year, Johnnie Mae was described as a cross
between Eva Peron and Mary Poppins.
Johnnie Mae made her mark on Arkadelphia, determined that her children would enjoy to the fullest the experiences
that the Norman Rockwellian setting provided. She threw herself into any endeavor that her children and grandchildren
wanted to pursue. When Becky Fuller, now Rebecca Ward, was the first person from the city to win a statewide election
at Girl's State, Johnnie Mae organized a city-wide homecoming celebration complete with a parade for all the
Arkadelphia delegates that included her daughter Nancy. When Johnnie Mae's daughter Jamie wanted to pursue rodeo
and barrel racing, Nonnie perfected her ability to sew cowgirl outfits while also cheering-on her daughter from the

stands. When her daughter Linda wanted to serve as a cheerleader for Arkadelphia High School and then Ouachita
Baptist University, Johnnie Mae and Steve's house became nerve-center for all events athletic. When daughter Nancy
returned to Arkadelphia in 1964 with seven-month-old Megan to raise, Johnnie and Steve provided a nurturing, loving
home for daughter and granddaughter. Megan was the grandchild who gave Johnnie Mae her proudest title: Johnnie
Mae became "Nonnie."
Nonnie was queen of a tribe of three generations of women known as "Spargo Girls." When her great-granddaughters
Frances and Eleanor were born in 1999, Nonnie was determined that the twin girls would not use an exclusive
communication method. Nonnie's special task was to talk with them extensively and one-on-one, making sure that the
girls' first desire was to talk to her. Active in Democratic politics at all levels and with a passion, she was equally a
dedicated life master of duplicate bridge and played many a set with her friends at the House of Bridge in Hot Springs.
Johnnie ultimately spent most of her time driving to wherever one of her children lived to help with whatever tasks of
life needed tending. In response to this demanding schedule, she famously responded, "You can sleep when you are
dead!" Her stock question when confronted with news from one of her children of a pending event — whether one was
receiving an award or going out for lunch — was "Well, what will you wear?" Raising all these Spargo girls, she was
expert not only at re-upholstering an entire set of living room furniture, she also sewed countless, spontaneous-yet-
appropriate attire, from couture evening gowns to cowgirl wear. Making ball gowns from the draperies was not
exclusive to other southern heroines.
Perhaps Johnnie Mae's most endearing qualities were unfailing optimism combined with great pragmatism. She lived in
the present and did not believe in guilt or regrets. Born before women could vote, she cast one of her last votes for the
woman she hoped would be the first woman President. When Hillary did not prevail, she once again enjoyed casting a
vote for a straight Democratic ticket. Nonnie would want the family to express special gratitude for the many kindnesses
extended to her by the staff and nurses at Presbyterian Village in Little Rock, where she resided since June 2009. Thank
you is extended also to Arkansas Hospice whose compassion and care comforted both family and friends. Thanks are
also expressed to the staff of Home Instead and their compassionate caregiver, Bette White. John Lee Roberts of
Arkadelphia provided unwavering help and assistance and was a much loved friend and companion to both Steve and
Johnnie Mae.
The family will have a visitation at 9:30-10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Ruggles-Wilcox Funeral Home in Arkadelphia, followed
by a graveside service at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Rose Hill Cemetery led by Father Douglas Anderson of St. James
Episcopal Church, Texarkana. Memorials may be made to Arkansas Hospice, 5600 W 12th St., Little Rock, Ark. 72204;
Presbyterian Village Foundation, 510 Brookside, Little Rock, Ark. 72205; or the Arkansas Nature Conservancy, 601 North

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The ""surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick up on—
the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed information about
Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of things that have been covered
in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and much more focused on Branch than I
had anticipated. While not as "and this day, and the next day" as My Life, it does share many of the same elements that
would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that there appears to be no index also makes it difficult
for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore, WJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection
through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC quotes was far fewer than I had expected.

HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with Branch
when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the Gephardt comment,
and didn't grab much attention at al1.[11 (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought that there should not be a
special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much aligned with her interactions with
Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in the book are those, which face the current
Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion of the
Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his connection with the
events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are strikingly sparsely discussed
such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not appear as thought WJC ever-dodged
questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life, one theme that repeated itself was WJC's
conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few
instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there
are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on
more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch could
write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends, later quashed,
who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does portray a helpful distinction in
how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have
him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are
some quips that could catch someone's eye, such as WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't
even recognize."
Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no other
lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason he didn't
mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if she was found to
be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a very small passage that
could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this before. (This is addressed more
fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship with Gore,
which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with Janet Reno. The
one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues are discussed in turn
below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed in a much more human light
than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her relationship with CVC and images of
affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.

On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans, China, Russia,
Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about Haiti is about Branch's own
experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion about North Korea, but nothing that has
not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in what seems to track mention of him in My Life,
which seems to have more detail and background than this book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the USSS
cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets would be lined
with "assassins." There are candid looks at WIC's take on certain people and the relationship between some, such as
Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's drinking, such as yelling outside of
Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders going, but
Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained interpretation of
the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Life only mentions Lee's
accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from Branch's book the first giving context
and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
0 The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security agencies,
indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his personal computer. Lee
was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown, solitary confinement—even though the
long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to China or anyone else. The president said experts were
telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged.
Nothing would please him more than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
0 While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret, uncharged and
untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without foreseeing such arbitrary
detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the legal limit...whether to bring charges on the
testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for
more than six months. One extreme detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American.
We accept guilty people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom." [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could send her
to jail, as she had denied it.
0 "Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of the affair. If
Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could have turned him into a
witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while original, struck me as tendentious. The
president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of
Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.

0 There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he complained that
if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to say "it was interesting, in fact,
that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet,
announcing gladly that his worries were over because the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she
replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She
said Kissing blanched, speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered
that his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,' Hillary
repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life." [Branch, 179]
HRC and gay/lesbian
Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WIC's counsel got very "exercised." WJC left the room. "He
was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life than Hillary.' He sighed. Her
temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues were even mentionable. New York
politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take. On the other hand, personal experience
could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with Moynihan.
For example:
0 When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could fight for
themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a freebie for him,' snapped
Clinton, 'and he knows it." [p.140]
0 In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan for aimless
hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]
0 Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a number of
them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was sure they had nothing to
hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely on the surface, never
produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny himself for five minutes, living in an apartment
secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765941 Date: 07/31/2015
0 "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted hypothetical
about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, "He doesn't understand...that he's conceding the principles."
WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press and said that Moynihan knew what he
was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption about Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several examples
follow:
0 Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the Clintons, with
the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room...Their agenda was a delicate race between Hussein's
failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of
national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed
electrical grids, and so on. Hussein gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch, 170]
0 South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule was far more demanding than
ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden women." [Branch, 236] Later
Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast with a superficial American press, which portrayed
Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords
with whirlwind encouragements for citizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting
Bhutto corresponds to a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, "she [HRC] played the traditional role of
First Lady as wife and mother...") [Branch, 246]
0 China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she depicted the
"harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the rave reviews of HRC's speech.
[Branch, 289]
0 Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed from urgent political
tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact with her
throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs gratitude, but the
fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765941 Date: 07/31/2015
0 "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called Chelsea at
Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was another story. Jesse said he
knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in American politics. He did not know everything
involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now
above all, and if she needed to counsel, rage, or pray, he was always available." [Branch, 497]
Tension with Janet Reno
Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative opinion of
Janet Reno.
0 "He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney general. If he
removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall
to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's wholesale devotion to outside control for any
case in which the president himself may become a target...lf he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would
touch off a firestorm of protest like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the
Watergate scandal. That was not an option." [Branch, 388-389]
0 Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and continuing to
allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy. Branch then outlines a meeting
between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her "desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like
that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I
hired her to work for me." [Branch, 398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good
achievements including coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on
Whitewater, but that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno had failed to
defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension the entire executive
branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her more naive than upright, and the
fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch, 399] He cites that Clinton warned her that she should prepare
herself for not staying in the job for the entire second term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter
There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to North Korea
and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be on the front lines.
17

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765941 Date: 07/31/2015
North Korea:
0 "On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore, and Clinton had
approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme isolation...Sure enough, Carter did reach North
Korean dictator Kim II-sung, who proposed to allow inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief
from the harsh economic sanctions. The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became
official, adding gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters, and he did not
believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt." [Branch, 162]
Haiti:
0 After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with Gore (who said
Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to Haiti to seek a truce with the
junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis' (arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus
what was in the United States' best interest). He didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North
Korea, Carter again, Carter went to the press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and
Carter, invited to stay over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the
next morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not right...The
press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent negotiators...He said the
current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that
Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with
restraint at their joint press conference, he allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he
had earned the right to speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the
United States government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-resident." [Branch,
200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
0 "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush. 'Dole will
support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he doesn't have much positive to
say." [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places where he is
briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the seemingly brutally candid
conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.

0 On page 92 Branch writes, "No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as alleged, but to
improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin." [Branch, 92]
0 In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also having Gore
substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other nations were offended that
Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to redeem himself and the administration for his
absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC "pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked.
So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to
take these exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and
were still wrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]
0 On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as a team to
secure the Cabinet for the second term.
0 Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second criminal
lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is about a leak of an offer
from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free. The exchange is more on ethics of the
offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
0 On Gore's announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his kickoff events—
once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were technical...But Gore got all the big
things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly
what he would do for them in the White House. The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third,
Gore would be badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, `if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post." [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues that
WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his campaign. "On tape, the president said he
confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must
project his platform—where he stood, precisely how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans
would try to knock him off substance." [Branch, 554]
0 WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not succeeding
him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart, experience, and motivated.
He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential character over detailed agendas for the
country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," but Clinton discounted this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would
wear well over time. Gore also was perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence,
which called for Gore to emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a
brooding quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature failed to
give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch, 599]

0 He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said the
president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had it not been for the vice
president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who would be a bright spot to run with,
perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though
she would never get chosen. How much of this was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is
unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be running essentially for a
third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would tarnish them with Clinton's
character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate that had been heard before—that Gore lacked
style and a light touch.
0 Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in one of their
stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he meant good on the policy,
and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend the two. Gore said he had to think about
it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the
message that Clinton must convey somehow without seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch, 623-624]
0 The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure at first
about recording the details. At the outset it says, "For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did he blame Clinton for his
defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him did." [Branch, 642] It has WJC
acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the White House. Then he says, "'I think you made a
mistake not to use me more in the last ten days," Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much
more upset about your message, now that we're being honest." [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought
bag saying that "Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an "unparalleled" vice president, but that
he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was "surreal."
o Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal had been
the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers
had tormented him now for four years. Gore said he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered
telling the president that he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for trouble. So he did
blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be
in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought he was in Neverland,' he said." [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported Clinton all through
the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated
that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened.
There was little to say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake. He

had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis. Well, he said, this is the first
time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed.
Their colliding perspectives made both of them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so
significant here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed honesty that
somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..." [Branch, 644-45]
Other
0 Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking Maggie to compile
confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. "Williams was shrewd, discreet, and efficient." [Branch, 161]
0 HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's suggestion to invade
Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the pressure, the lack of options, and his
sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign policy staff. He said she observed with some
suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake, Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed
the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray Inman as defense secretary." [Branch, 189]
0 ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book. Quinn said that
HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn. HRC said Feinman had withdrawn
from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be
about him and how it affected him as a ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor
that HRC and a female veterinarian of Socks' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House."
[Branch, 342-343]
0 Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had subpoenaed all
those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were there. This included "some two
dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed the subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]
0 Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, "In our glancing
associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as lighthearted or
recreational." [Branch, 495]
0 Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their best chance
to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, 'but I don't think Al would ever do it." [Branch, 540]

0 WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting HRC if she
decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the two events are unconnected.
"When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He
could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..." [Branch, 557]
0 On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because "of hard intelligence
that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses the cancelled trip but does
not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.

RELEASE IN FULL
Sensitive But Unclassified
To: The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of State
Thru: Cheryl Mills, Counselor and Chief of Staff
From: Reta Jo Lewis, Special Representative, Global Intergovernmental Affairs
Date: December 31, 2009
Subject: The Next Six Months - Work Plan
I. Introduction
The next six months will be a critical time for establishing the Department's leadership in
bridging relationships for U.S. intergovernmental officials and their foreign counterparts,
defining the mission and role of the Office of the Special Representative for Global
Intergovernmental Affairs (""S/SRGIA"), and outlining an agenda that serves the needs of the
Department and these officials. Our approach will be strategic and integrated, working in
collaboration with Department bureaus and USAID offices to strengthen and deliver on the
Secretary's and Administration's priorities.
II. Key Objectives
The Special Representative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs will serve the global
needs of the U.S. intergovernmental officials and the entities they represent. The S/SRGIA will
also connect U.S. state and local officials with intergovernmental officials around the world,
promote local capacity building investments and programs to enhance country-led processes, and
facilitate the needs and goals of intergovernmental officials here and abroad consistent with
Department priorities.
III. Next Steps
This work plan describes activities that the S/SRGIA plans to initiate, grow and
implement in the next six months. To place the Work Plan in context, we describe below
S/SRGIA' s work-planning process.
A. Establish S/SRGIA Mission and Role in the Department.
Currently, no one and no office in the State Department has accountability to serve the
needs of intergovernmental officials, (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected leaders, the entities
that represent them) with respect to their global affairs portfolios. State and local officials'
concerns are typically routed on an individual basis through bureaus with the results reflecting ,
the priority of the person in the bureau's estimation or the nature of the request. Priority
activities will be as follows:
1
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766082 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766082 Date: 08/31/2015
Sensitive But Unclassified
• Confirm the Secretary's support to focus on priority issues and countries;
• Join Department's meetings and conversations with visiting foreign state and local
representatives and dignitaries to establish S/SRGIA's role;
• Strengthen support on global intergovernmental affairs issues internally in the State
Department, by explaining the value of these stakeholders;
• Track deployment of resources assisting intergovernmental officials and leverage the
State Department's collective U.S. and global intergovernmental relationships;
• Follow and interpret international issues (e.g., food security, global health, climate
change, trade and economic development, energy) of importance to state governments;
• Promote dialogue between the Department (e.g., USAID, EEB, ECA, Public Private
Partnerships, Global Women's Issues, Consular Affairs, MCC and targeted Regional
Bureaus) and external constituents (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected officials, and
the entities that they represent) for more effective partnerships and relationships; and
• Collaborate with the Public Diplomacy and INR to create a survey of foreign
intergovernmental affairs officials to determine their needs and engage U.S.
intergovernmental officials to learn how the Department should help to further their
global goals.
B. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of
U.S. intergovernmental officials.
State economies are increasingly globalized, and more and more U.S. companies are
competing in international markets and against firms worldwide. As the principal stewards of
their states' economic success, Governors recognize that the global marketplace presents both
challenges and opportunities and that states must address both to ensure their continued
competitiveness. Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach
activities in partnership with its participating US and other intergovernmental and international
organizations. U.S. national organizations who serve governmental authorities include but are
not limited to the following:
• National Governors Association;
• National Lt. Governors Association;
• U.S. Conference of Mayors;
• National League of Cities;
• National Association of Counties/Large Urban County Caucus;
• National Association of States Attorney Generals;
• National State Legislatures; and
• Councils of State Governments.
Outreach is essential to many aspects of the Department's activities. S/SRGIA's outreach
objective is to promote and increase the general awareness of the benefits of the State
Department efforts in global intergovernmental affairs, especially among decision makers and
policy makers, educational entities, non-governmental organizations, public-interest groups and
public agencies. S/SRGIA will provide international outreach services to state and local elected
officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and all other inhabited U.S.
territories. Specific objectives are to:

• Build state by state profiles, thus creating a set of priorities and identifying opportunities
for collaboration with state and local officials on their global projects and Department
priorities;
• Establish our target list of public officials to assist and nurture relationships with
principals and the organizations that represent them and their global needs;
• Create dialogue with the Governors and Mayors in preparation for the NGA and Mayors
Washington conferences in the fall;
• Travel to conferences and meetings within the United States and countries abroad
required to implement the Department's global intergovernmental affairs agenda;
• Develop a network of leaders, to collaborate and create partnerships;
• Coordinate meetings between Department of State experts and state and local officials;
• Support targeted elected officials trade missions and other official trips abroad;
• Develop a strategy for deliverables such as multilateral pacts and Memorandum of
Understandings on key State Department priorities that we will sign with responsible
parties; and
• Collaboration with EEB, to partner with them to engage state and local government
leaders in the bureaus enhanced commercial diplomacy efforts (e.g. the Administration's
National Export Initiative and EEB/Consular Affairs Business Visa Facilitation initiative,
etc.).
C. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of
middle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials.
Currently, ECA conducts a significant number of exchanges with foreign and
domestic government officials. None of ECA's programs target regions with the
objective of enhancing another country's government systems because the bureau's
authorities do not permit any type of training since everything must be done under the
auspices of enhancing mutual understanding. The most visible ECA program is the
International Visitor Leadership Program which in FY09 brought in 1,390 foreign
government officials at the state, city and national levels to gain knowledge around the
US political system and culture. To date, the bureau estimates the same number of
government visitors in FY10.
Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities in
partnership with international organizations. International organizations who serve local
governmental authorities include but are not limited to the following:
• United Cities and Local Governments;
• Metropolis;
• The World Urban Forum;
• UN-HABITAT;
• Latin American and Caribbean Ministers of Housing and Urbanization;
• UN Advisory Committee of Local Authorities;
• The World Mayors Council on Climate Change;

• Sister Cities International;
• Local Governments for Sustainability; and
• Municipal Development Partnerships which targets governments in Africa.
Priority activities will be as follows:
• S/SRGIA will collaborate with Public Diplomacy to conduct stakeholder outreach
with strategic countries — e.g. Af, Pak, Iraq — and key emerging powers (Brazil,
India, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria) and developing countries (Rwanda,
Ethiopia, Kenya, etc.) to obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of middle
and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials;
• Collaborate with [NR to assist us in gaining a better understanding of what
foreign intergovernmental affairs officials want to engage with their US
counterparts ranging from engagement on a host of common policy concerns,
opportunities, programs and connections.
D. Provide Leadership for Department Intergovernmental Capacity Building.
One of our largest challenges in most developing countries is the lack of capacity in the
government below the President and Prime Minister level. As the Department seeks to
implement development programs or conduct diplomacy, there is often limited local counterpart
capacity to do so with or to empower. S/SRGIA will work with USAID and State bureaus and
offices to provide connections and leadership development to build the capacity of
intergovernmental officials in countries around the world. Currently, millions of dollars of
USAID and ECA grants that support capacity building are typically carried out by contractors
and have results that are not transparent in their reporting or impact. S/SRGIA will partner with
existing offices to provide leadership for the investment in this space, accountability for the
outcomes and programming, and foster relationships between intergovernmental officials here in
the US with foreign partners to mentor and model what is needed.
S/SRGIA capacity building strategies will primarily be based on best practices derived
from studying successful and less-successful approaches. Within the next six months, S/SRGIA
will work in partnership with Department and USAID bureaus and resources. Priority activities
will be as follows:
• Identify State Department investments, canvass additional State Department dedicated
resources other than grant-making and assess the strength of the current environment
needed to advance the S/SRGIA's Secretary capacity building agenda for state and local
leaders; participate in QDDR process regarding this agenda;
• Develop an agenda for a high-level retreat on the formulation of a National Capacity
Development Strategy to present achievements to date, lessons learned and proposals for
institutional capacity development going forward;
• Work with the Chiefs of Missions and other diplomats in countries where capacity
building is critical to the success of our diplomacy and development efforts;

• Amplify and sustain high quality and results driven support to institutional capacity
development by assisting in advocating for increased funding and building public-private
partnerships;
• Prioritize discrete initiatives to "fast track", based on importance, regional priorities (e.g.,
Asia, Africa and Latin America), assessment of readiness, impact and feasibility and
translate priorities into actionable interventions;
• Develop a network of experts involved in existing capacity-building initiatives related to
global intergovernmental affairs and build partnerships;
• Define a coordinated approach and institutional responsibilities for supporting the GIA
capacity building initiative; and
• Identify opportunities for further collaboration with state and local officials on their
projects and Department priorities.
IV. Administrative Activities
• Standardize requests for assistance with projects related to policy, business, trade,
consular affairs, etc.; and
• Link the Department website to states websites and trade and development office
websites.
V. Budget and Staffing
S/SRGIA will require a budget and staffing to fulfill its mission.
VI. Assessment of Progress
The short term goal will be to engage U.S. intergovernmental officials about their global
concerns. The S/SRGIA office will become a significant resource for high-level State
Department engagement for U.S. state and local elected officials. The benefits of this new office
will be immediate and grow over time as our engagement deepens. Assisting US states and local
governments to expand their exports, promote locations for foreign investment and for
participation in State Department priorities are some of the short term benefits we hope to
achieve with respect to U.S. intergovernmental officials.
With respect to the global intergovernmental officials, in the short term, we expect to
work with our Regional Bureaus and Offices, (e.g., USAID, ECA, EEB, etc.) to assess the
current state of play and assist us with how we better target and leverage our assistance to this
constituency.
In the longer term, institutionally, we need to sustain relationships with our embassies
and missions overseas, so that they can assist state and local officials and their constituencies to
expand their global business base. As related to our national capacity building strategy, in the
long term, we seek to empower and educate and build relationships with state and local officials
abroad. We also seek accountability for the outcomes of the programming and will provide

to work here for Secretary Clinton and you. Thank you for supporting our efforts so heartily. What you said today about
Capricia is spot on..she is an amazing mentor and guiding force.
When she came up with the idea for the lunch, she said she wanted everyone to walk away feeling like that was time
well spent. She achieved that and more.

Subject: Proposed Final Retreat Agenda
Attachments: 2009-09-28 Senior Leadership Retreat - Discussion Draft - Revised2.docx
Attached and below is the proposed final Retreat Agenda.
The chief challenge I see is in having each bureau give 3 minutes on their top 3 priorities.
I think it is worthwhile from the standpoint that this is the first time all will be together with the chance to see/meet and
hear from everyone, but it will take time to hear from everyone. I've broken it up into 2 sections of an hour
each. Without these sections, the Retreat would breathe — with them it's tight though I have left padding in each
section.
I also am holding a place for up front for Susan Rice to present if she comes — she has not rsvped.
Please see below and attached and advise if there are other suggested changes.
Bill Burns cannot attend the retreat and currently will give his update on Iran to Jim; we also will have Jim address Iraq in
his overview too.

H: Of interest, Hague latest briefing, hostile to Tony. Tories desperately do not want Blair there, want to run their own

`Appointing Blair as EU president will have
consequences', warns Hague
William Hague's strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the EU ambassadors baffled
Francis Elliott, David Charter and Tom Baldwin
William Hague has been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to convince European ambassadors that Tony Blair
would be a bad choice for European Union president, The Times has learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunch
organised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nations
against the appointment.
EU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next week's summit, but the Czech Republic's last-minute
objections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision, however, and is
understood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post.
In making the Conservatives' case against Mr Blair, Mr Hague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Minister
had consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr Hague also reminded the diplomats
of Mr Blair's actions in the run-up to the Iraq war, according to one of those attending the lunch last Thursday.
A claim that Mr Hague told the ambassadors that the Tories would regard Mr Blair's appointment as a ""declaration of war"
by the EU was denied, however. A spokesman for Mr Hague said that the phrase was "a bit strong". Nevertheless, it was
not disputed that Mr Hague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain and
Brussels. Diplomats said that there was a "clear mark of hostility".
"Mr Hague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment of
Tony Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of accountability and legitimacy
involved in the creation of the position in the first place," Mr Hague's spokesman said. Mr Hague's strident attack on his
fellow Briton reportedly left some of the ambassadors baffled.
Mr Hague is currently in Washington for talks with members of the Obama Administration, including Hillary Clinton, the
Secretary of State, with whom he raised the issue of the Conservatives' membership of a right-wing alliance of European
parties with allegedly anti-Semitic members. He accused critics of running a smear campaign against some of the group,
led by Michal Kaminsky, head of Poland's Law and Justice Party.

Subject: Haiti: PM Concerns & Mexico Assistance Conference
Cheryl, Meghann,
Below is some intel David got on the Mexico conference David picked up from the Mexicans here. The conference's
timing would be extremely awkward if things proceed as Guy Noel suggests:
Guy reports that ""they" have decided to go forward with:
1)October 29th Interpellation (Impeachment) of the PM
2) Oct. 31St the president will add the ratification of the new PM on the existing list of the LOWER HOUSE activities
(which Guy asserts is illegal)
3) November 3rd Nomination of the new PM
4) Then the ratification of the PM
You can bet that the PM will repeat all this verbatim to George Soros when she sees him today. Not sure what - if
anything - that will provoke.
got this information too and has a pre-scheduled meeting with Preval today. I understand he plans on
raising this. We'll let you know what we hear.
In my Tuesday lunch with Gabriel I mentioned in very clear terms our concern about any sort of turmoil in government
reflecting very badly on the international community's efforts to tout Haiti as stable and open for investment. He said
he understood. He said, "I don't see Michelle (Pierre-Louis) going anywhere soon." He conceded that while Preval did
have a majority in Parliament, he could not control all parliamentarians on all issues.
We'll try and get in to see someone from the Senate in the coming days.
This is why a call would be most useful.

international community's engagement with Haiti (both political and assistance), but that it has morphed into a donor's
meeting to discuss coordination of assistance. Originally they planned to invite Foreign Ministers, but now they are
inviting the heads of assistance agencies. Preval was originally to attend, but he has decided to send his Foreign
Minister and the Minister of Planning. Romero indicated that the GOM has not received the number and caliber of
confirmations of attendance that they had hoped for. I asked Romero what outcome the GOM would like to see from
the meeting, and he said that they want to encourage donors to coordinate more with the GOH and among themselves.
The GOM hosted an "experts" meeting on Haiti two weeks ago where a number of individuals long involved in Haiti
presented position papers on the political, economic and assistance challenges in Haiti. He said that a common theme
of the papers was the need for greater donor coordination. He will send me a set of the position papers. Mexico is not a
donor to Haiti.

individual basis, it is rare to have the opportunity for all of us to be in the same place at the same time with no formal
agenda. You have assembled a great team -- which has both an abundance of smarts and personality — and I'm grateful
that we had a chance to see each other one more time before we all dispersed for the holidays. Looking forward to
2010, Zia.

Happy New Year to you, too! I'm sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
On menu: As a start, I can make a list of the lunches that he's made so far. Jason is given money advances. I'm not
positive of the total for last year since I came in April but I can have that answer for you by morning. I have skim milk for
you.
On the Human Rights Watch Report: I found it online and will print. It is 96 pages so I can put this in a binder if you'd like.
Parks and Recreation: NBC Thursdays at 8:30pm The Good Wife: CBS Tuesdays at lOpm
And it is a huge honor to work for you. I learn so much every day and I am so grateful for this unforgettable experience.
Thank you!

Monica--I hope you had a wonderful holiday season and thank you for all of your help this past year. You've been a life
saver. I'm looking forward to 2010 being even better.
Here are a few things as we start the year--
I'd like to work w you to prepare a menu for Jason. Also does he give me a monthly bill for the food he buys and
prepares for me?
Could you or he buy skim milk for me to have for my tea? Also, pls remind me to bring more tea cups from home.
Also, pls try to get me a copy of the Human Rights Watch report titled ""We Have the Promises of the World: Women's
Rights in Afghanistan."
Can you give me times for two TV shows: Parks and Recreation and The Good Wife?

Possibility of Senate Run, Nurtured and Abandoned By MICHAEL BARBARO March 03, 2010 New York Times
A few weeks ago, Harold E. Ford Jr. had a telephone conversation with his friend Doug Band, the powerful counselor to
former President Bill Clinton.
Mr. Ford, the former Tennessee congressman who now works on Wall Street, wanted to discuss a potential challenge to
Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York's Democratic primary, a possibility he had flirted with for weeks.
But Mr. Band was not encouraging. He told Mr. Ford that with Democrats reeling from political setbacks across the
country, it would be bad for the party and his career if he entered the race. ""It's not the right thing to do," he said,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation.
A Ford spokesman confirmed the call but denied that Mr. Ford had been discouraged from running or that he had been
told that doing so would hurt the party. The spokesman said Mr. Band told him the White House had pressured Mr.
Clinton into supporting Ms. Gillibrand.
Mr. Ford's decision not to run for the Senate, which he disclosed on Tuesday, came after he reached out to dozens of
donors, advocates and political leaders. In private conversations, the same worries emerged: that a race against Ms.
Gillibrand would be a brutal fight, dominated by endless debates about when he began paying taxes as a New York
resident and the sincerity of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights.
A campaign that he had hoped would focus on tax cuts and job growth would instead, he feared, become mired in
discussions of "who got there first, and who meant it the most," on social issues, he told an associate. That might allow a
Republican opponent to swoop in and take the seat from the bloodied Democratic nominee.
What seemed to weigh on him, interviews with dozens of people who have met and spoken to his advisers revealed,
was not his status as a carpetbagger who had moved to New York from Tennessee, but rather the reality that there were
few easy constituencies for him to grab on to, outside of Wall Street, where he has worked since moving here in 2006.
Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as disclosing private conversations.
As he hopscotched from city to city, charming crowds with bits of his Southern biography, signs of trouble for Mr. Ford
emerged. His voting record in Congress put him on the right fringes of state Democrats, and his $2 million-a-year job at
Merrill Lynch made it hard to run as a Scott Brown-style populist.
What seemed like an improbable, even impossible campaign had its roots in conversations, many dating back a year,
among Mr. Ford, 39, and a coterie of powerful friends from New York City, Washington and Los Angeles.
Over dinner last July at the Post House, a clubby steakhouse on the Upper East Side, Richard Plepler, a co-president of
HBO, urged Mr. Ford to restart his political career in New York. "I think you should give this serious thought," he said, of
the Senate race. Mr. Ford replied that he would.
After the dinner, Mr. Plepler sent an e-mail message to Douglas E. Schoen, a top Democratic pollster, to bounce the idea
off him. Mr. Schoen was intrigued, and as he studied public polls, became convinced that Mr. Ford's best shot at
reaching the Senate was to wage a campaign against Ms. Gillibrand.

Over the next few months, Mr. Ford sounded out many of New York's wealthiest and most politically connected
executives, frequently over breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue: Robert Wolf, the head of the United States
investment banking division at UBS; Ronald Perelman, the billionaire chairman of Revlon; and Steven Rattner, the
founder of Quadrangle, the private equity firm, all of whom are big Democratic donors.
Mr. Rattner told Mr. Ford, who is also a political analyst on NBC, that money would not be a problem. "You can raise the
money," he told him in December.
Yet several big-name donors warned him that Ms. Gillibrand, a relentless campaigner, had beaten him to the punch.
"She has already locked a lot of Wall Street up" was the message that Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge fund manager,
conveyed to Mr. Ford in a telephone conversation.
As Mr. Ford traveled outside New York City, especially upstate, he found political support for Ms. Gillibrand to be
shallow, and the hunger for change palpable. The mayor of Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, told him that residents there
were "scared and desperate" about the economy, and she told Mr. Ford that Ms. Gillibrand was a rare presence in her
city.
But Ms. Gillibrand's strategy of portraying Mr. Ford as a showboating out-of-towner was starting to stick. In late January,
the head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, held a luncheon for Mr. Ford, and invited local
lawmakers. During a two-hour question-and-answer session, Marty Markowitz, the borough president, pointed to
several up-and-coming state senators around the room and observed that all of them had greater experience in New
York politics than Mr. Ford.
"With all due respect," he asked Mr. Ford, "why do you think you have what it takes to be New York's senator?"
Even lawmakers who seemed open to a Ford candidacy warned him that peeling away support from Ms. Gillibrand
would be harder than it seemed.
Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, told Mr. Ford between bites of an omelet at a diner near his office, "It's
difficult to make a strong case against her here." Ms. Gillibrand, he explained, had just secured $4 million worth of
federal stimulus money to train his constituents for green jobs. Mr. Ford knew that some liberals would attack his
relatively conservative voting record but, those he spoke with said, he was taken aback by the depth of the anger he
encountered from advocates for abortion rights and gay marriage.
After reporters found examples of Mr. Ford calling himself pro-life during his time in Congress, Mr. Ford vehemently
pushed back, saying he had always supported a woman's right to choose. He assumed that would put the matter to rest.
It did not. "He was dumbfounded that it kept tripping him up," a friend said.
One of Mr. Ford's top advisers, Bradley Tusk, the campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's 2009 re-election,
arranged a meeting for Mr. Ford with a close Bloomberg ally, Kelli Conlin, the head of Naral-Pro Choice of New York. Mr.
Ford expected a polite conversation that would help neutralize a foe. Ms. Conlin, however, started the meeting by
quizzing Mr. Ford on his voting record and public statements.
Did he realize, she asked, that he had backed legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions even when a woman's
health is in danger?
Far from conciliatory, Mr. Ford wanted to know why Naral allowed Ms. Gillibrand to vote for a health care bill that cut
off financing for abortions. "You gave her a pass," he said. Before leaving, Mr. Ford told Ms. Conlin that if he chose to
run he hoped to return to ask for the group's support. Ms. Conlin responded: "We can never support you if you take
these positions." Mr. Ford "looked shocked," a person in the room said.

His meeting with gay rights advocates on Feb. 24 was rockier still. When he walked into the headquarters of the
Stonewall Democrats in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, he was greeted by signs that read "Liar!" and "Go
home snake oil Harry," a reference to his recent support for gay marriage after having twice voted to outlaw it in
Congress.
A few days later, the results of a poll that Mr. Ford had paid for out of his own pocket began to trickle in, giving his
advisers pause. His negative ratings had increased slightly. A liberal primary electorate seemed wary about portions of
his record. Ms. Gillibrand remained vulnerable, the data showed, but Mr. Ford's chance seemed to be 50-50. "It was not
a slam dunk, at all," said a person who spoke with him and was briefed on the data.
Mr. Tusk had told associates that to win, Mr. Ford needed 80 percent of the state's black vote, a tall order, but not
inconceivable for an African-American in a Democratic primary. But by the end of the week, Gov. David A. Paterson and
Representative Charles B. Rangel had become embroiled in ethics scandals. New York's black political elite was in
seeming disarray, just when he needed them to be organized and unified.
By Sunday, he had made up his mind not to run. He told his wife, Emily, and his father, former Representative Harold
Ford Sr. He began to call friends the next evening, leaving many of them brief messages.
"I'm not going to run this time," he said in one message. "Thank you for your support."

Karl, Frank, Richard.,
I hope in the next few days we can focus on some of the themes in the following:
1. On 9 April, I had lunch in Kabul with expert on
Afghanistan now based at was on his way back B6
to Washington via a meeting in Paris with the French Political Director. He had just spend three
weeks in Kandahar and Gardez, his first visit since August last year. He came across as patriotic, but
deeply worried, speaking in a monologue, mostly in French.
OVERALL SITUATION
2. said that his assessment was that the overall situation had deteriorated sharply since his
last visit. The Taliban were stronger, and more confident, than ever. ISAF was inflicting heavy losses
on them, but the scale was as nothing compared with what the mujahideen had endured at the hands
of the Russians. Moreover, the change in rules of engagement — to prevent civilian casualties, and
fewer night raids — had been interpreted by the Taliban as signalling weakness on NATO's part. In
view, most of the East, and Kunduz, was effectively lost to the Taliban and their fellow
travellers. US forces in the East controlled the ground they occupied or passed over, but little more:
they were in a similar position to the Soviet Army. Moreover, the population did not want to back
them, and was resisting US attempts to set up tribal militias or implant US Special Forces in the
villages, did, however, acknowledge that he had heard that the US Marines in Helmand were
behaving much more sensitively towards the population than had been expected. But the situation in
Marjah was not good. Of course, the Marines held the ground, but violence would continue for
months or years. This did not offer the positive signal of momentum for which the Coalition had been
hoping.
KANDAHAR

3. aid repeatedly that he did not understand the strategy in Kandahar. The Taliban had
effectively penetrated, and largely controlled, a city of one million people. The ANP there were
largely Barakzai, and working for either or both of the Taliban or Ahmed Wali Karzai's network. AWK
was at the centre of a vast criminal enterprise: his brother-in-law was one of the largest drug
traffickers in the south. When I said that surely ISAF could gradually occupy the city, squeezing the
Taliban back and out, said he was not certain of that: he thought that there might well be quite
violent resistance from the Taliban. He was also dismissive of the ISAF strategy of ""managing" AWK:
if the latter really did abandon his criminal ways, he would be dead. He would lose the protection of
his militias. In such situations, one could only move forward, or go into prison or exile: there was no
going back. AWK had just too many enemies to survive in Kandahar without the protection of his own
criminal networks, guess was that AWK would promise to be good, but in reality stick to his
old habits, and hope to profit from the action taken by ISAF against the Taliban. was
dismissive of efforts to empower Governor Weesa, who would not survive five minutes in Kandahar
without Western support and protection. Although Weesa came from the area, he had no power base,
and, with his Canadian nationality, was regarded by the Kandaharis as a foreigner.
4. was also sceptical as to whether ISAF could "shura" its way to success in Kandahar. On the
military side, he thought ISAF just couldn't generate the force densities necessary to control the city:
for example, he thought the Argandab would require getting on for 15,000 troops to control it
properly. The city of Kandahar would require some 10,000 fresh police, who were just not available.
NEXT STEPS
5. said he was worried about where the coalition was heading. The best that could be
expected was a messy stalemate in Kandahar, but the probability was, by the early autumn, an
outcome that would not look at all like success, wondered whether ISAF really did need to go
ahead with its plan to take Kandahar: in view, he was riding for a fall. I said that I did not see
how we could pull back now. The planners were well aware of the risks, but wanted to generate
positive momentum to enable a political process to take hold.
MAKING PEACE
6. said that, in his view, the only way out now was a negotiated peace with the Taliban and all
the other parties to the conflict. He thought that Pakistan would need to help Karzai and the
Americans open such a dialogue with the Taliban, but, sooner or later, both Pakistan and Karzai
would need to be moved to one side, and there would need to be direct talks between the Americans
and the Taliban. The Taliban would not make a final peace with Karzai, who had little credibility left.
Similarly, the senior Taliban leaders would need to be brought across the border into Afghanistan, to
get them out from under the control of the ISI. All this would need deception and trickery: for the first
time in his career, could see that diplomats were needed, in this case to finesse a delicate
process, involving multiple negotiations. Karzai would have to eased out, but gently and with plenty
of public respect.
7. said that there would need to be a cease-fire, and wondered why ISAF couldn't occupy the
high ground by being the first to offer such a move. There would also have to be frank discussions
about the withdrawal of foreign forces.
8. said that his main worry was that the Obama Administration would waste another year
ploughing on with a military campaign which could deliver stalemate at best, and a serious reverse at
worst. Then, with the 2011-12 Presidential election campaign getting going, the White House would
panic, handing the problem to Pakistan, and pull US troops out more quickly than the situation

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768229 Date: 08/31/2015
merited. It was vital to get ahead of the curve, and start making preparations now for a messy
political process that could last months or years.
9. said that he had known from 2001 that the Western intervention in Afghanistan had been
fraught with danger. He had suspected then, and knew even more strongly now, that the Taliban
could not be defeated or even properly contained by military means. Once again, he was sick with
worry at the way things were going. He had thought that the Obama Administration had understood
that the solutions in Afghanistan were political, not military. He was trying to think how he and other
concerned experts could shock the Administration in getting a political grip on the situation: he was
considering a joint op-ed by a group of experts. The seriousness of the situation meant that such an
article would have to concentrate on essentials: much of the talk about counter-insurgency (in what
was an Afghan civil war) and development and governance was no more than "poetry".
10. I pointed out to the political difficulties for the US and other Western governments in
negotiating direct with the Taliban. Although the principle of a negotiated peace was accepted, more
or less, in Washington and London, there was a long way to go before politicians fully addressed
what that might involve. Hence the argument that we needed first to get on the front foot militarily. It
would help if the Taliban could be pinned down on politically neuralgic issues, such as women's rights
and social restrictions, said that, in a serious negotiation, he thought such undertakings could
be extracted from the Taliban: again, however, the sooner work started on that, the more chance of a
satisfactory result.
11. I told that much of this thinking coincided with the views expressed by the Foreign
Secretary in his article in The New York Review of Books of 29 April 2010 had missed the MIT
speech, as he had been in Kandahar). The UK election campaign meant that there was little that
could be done over the next few weeks, apart from making sure that incoming or returning Ministers
had the best possible advice. After the election, there was clearly a case for a good strategic
discussion between the British Prime Minister and the American President: we all needed to raise our
eyes from the urgent tactical preoccupations in the south to the really important strategic issues, of
harvesting political success from military progress.

From: David Domenici [mailto
Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2010 8:54 PM
To: Mills, Cheryl D
Subject: Griot education project in Haiti - anothter idea -- much quicker ramp-up
Cheryl:
After watching scenes on TV, talking w/ you and others, here is idea for nearly immediate way to get kids back 'in school'
or into school for the first time. It would be very cheap, could get started very soon—say mid-February, could be linked to
other distribution networks (food/medical supplies), and would be quite organic and grassroots. I'll call it the Griot
education project (in the west African tradition of a streetside storytellers).
Context/Understanding:
Looks like there are a few hundred thousand kids in Port-au-Prince who pretty soon will be (already are) sitting around
day-to-day w/ more or less nothing to do. Their schools got destroyed, their neighborhoods in rough shape. These are
young kids who would be best served if they could get out of the house for a few hours a day (possibly even freeing up
parents to do rebuilding or other work), and not spend their time getting caught up in crime, or desperately searching
through rubble for a mal to eat... and get back to school, and engage their naturally curious brains.
The goal of this program is to immediately give them a place to go, a chance to interface with an energetic educator, and
at least expose them to relevant, skill-enhancing academic work that engages them while we rebuild education
infrastructure. It also would likely get them 1 meal each day, and if needed a way to get referred for immediate medical
attention.
Griot Educators:
We recruit and equip a cadre of teachers who will go out into communities with a set of portable materials each moming-
educators who after a few days will find a place to teach, and will have attracted class of students. This is modeled off the
street artist/storyteller.
We flyer the neighborhoods, advertising teaching positions. We work w/ whoever we can find who can help us identify
people who were good teachers prior to the earthquake and/or people who have the abilty to attract kids (appropriately).
We select teachers. We agree to pay them a daily/weekly stipend. We want people who know their communities, who
don't need a lot of direction, who will take a cart full of educational materials, find a corner, or abandoned building and
start teaching to whoever shows up. People who will do anything to get some young kids to try to read or do some math
problems or sing songs and write poetry...
Education Supply Centers
We set up education supply centers and a distribution system. Each center is staffed by small team-1 lead person is an
education-leader, others are admin and support. Griots come the center in the morning, they get a day's worth of
educational materials (we select it, we photocopy it, we give them 50 pencils, etc.). We agree to send over 50 meals two
hours later. Each Griot wheels his portable classroom to his/her spot and sets up shop... Kids come, and he/she
teaches. It builds momentum and kids get off the streets, out of their homes and come to the morning 'school' site. Kids
who come get a meal. Maybe we end up w/ 3 tiers of Griots-1 who works w/ 4, 5, 6 year olds, 1 with 7, 8, 9 year olds, 1
with 10, 11, 12 year olds. Each one picks up a packet of material that is more or less appropriate for that age group. All
this is incredibly flexible and fluid. Maybe one morning session and then an after lunch session.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769288 Date: 08/31/2015
The education supply centers are warehouses we set up. They have copiers, lots of paper, basic school supplies, some
art supplies, etc. (Over time, maybe people donate a bunch of books or magazines, etc—they become ways for artists,
volunteers, entertainers to connect w/ kids, as well.) Each morning a group of Griots go to their supply centers and pick
up materials, and fill up their cart... and roll down the block, or blocks and set up their 'school' for the day. Maybe someone
wants to donate a bunch of art supplies, or harmonicas—who knows—whatever it takes to get kids to show up and do
some academic and enrichment activities. These education supply centers likely get linked to other distribution hubs. This
way they can get linked w/ food or other supplies.
Longer-term/setting the stage for longer-term ramp up
Over time, some of the Griots will end up running little schools that start to feel permanent. Kids will bring in chairs and
stools...maybe some of the teaching material ends up staying at the school sites, and the end up as likely places for folks
to build/rebuild schools. But in the near term, the 'school' is whatever spot the Griot goes to where he/she can attract a
cadre of kids—and the good news is that can be almost anywhere.
This program is cheap -- as costly as it is to pay stipends to the Griots, plus the cost of supplies, delivery, and some
human capital to man the supply centers, develop/acquire high interest, high educational value material. I think quite
cheap, and could easily be costed out once we knew about how much we need to pay a Griot for a day of teaching.
It also gets some folks working, immediately.
Some Griots would take stipend and not teach; some wouldn't do it well; some would pawn off the food/biscuits...But we
could weed much of that out and w/ this sort of approach, you don't let a few bad apples spoil the larger program (or fear
of them stop it from getting started). This program is about planting the seeds for the future schools to come, about
getting young kids off streets and stoops and into a fun/learning environment, about empowering talented teacher-artists
to go out into their communities armed w/ some basic materials, their good will, their creativity (and a paycheck)—together
the kids and the Griots will find local places to call and claim as their schools.
And while this is going on, we have time to build out infrastructure (human capital, facilities, instructional/curricular
materials) for more robust ramp-up over time.
Per usual, feel free to ignore or pass on.

On a rainy, gloomy Sunday I write to you in the hope that we will have agreement from Secretary Clinton to accept the
""distinguished Diplomat" award at VMI. I am assured by the Superintendent, General JHB Peay, and the department
head of International Relations/Political Science, Colonel Jim Hentz that the award is hers if she will accept it. This is a
"done deal."
All that is needed for her to receive an official letter from General Peay is for me to know that she will accept the
award. They want to
give her the award this year on a suitable day before graduation in late May. The letter will ask her to address the corps
of cadets in a suitable on post (campus) setting. I would like to see it in Jackson Memorial Hall, a beautiful medieval
revival building. An alternative setting would be the two story atrium in the Marshall Center for Leadership and
Ethics. The award would be presented at the end of the address. Media coverage would be welcomed and
assisted. She would be honored by being the reviewing person at a regimental review of the corps. A suitable dinner
and or luncheon would be arranged.
If this is going to happen it would be a good idea to set the wheels in motion as soon as possible so that the staffs can
work out the details.

The Runaway General
Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan,
has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the
real enemy: The wimps in the White House
By Michael Hastings
Jun 22, 2010 10:00 AM EDT
This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.
'Howed I get screwed into going to this dinner?"" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April,
and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in
Paris. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually
have allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United
States. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president
and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to
keep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.
"The dinner comes with the position, sir," says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.
McChrystal turns sharply in his chair.
"Hey, Charlie," he asks, "does this come with the position?"
McChrystal gives him the middle finger.
The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations
center. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet,
hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian
casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his
advisers says, is the "most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine." The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any
place with candles on the tables as too "Gucci." He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega
Nights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt
comfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the
Pentagon's most secretive black ops.
"What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car
bombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.
"We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed," Flynn says.
McChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in
Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up or
disappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.
"I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner," McChrystal says.
He pauses a beat.
"Unfortunately," he adds, "no one in this room could do it."
With that, he's out the door.
"Who's he going to dinner with?" I ask one of his aides.
"Some French minister," the aide tells me. "It's fucking gay."

The next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French
military academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes
with a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss
off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he
gave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as
"shortsighted," saying it would lead to a state of "Chaos-istan." The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president
himself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal
seemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile
Now, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get
today, and how he should respond. "I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem," he says.
Then, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-
liner.
"Are you asking about Vice President Biden?" McChrystal says with a laugh. "Who's that?"
"Biden?" suggests a top adviser. "Did you say: Bite Me?"
When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign
promise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. "I want the
American people to understand," he announced in March 2009. "We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle
and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan." He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since
the war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David
McKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had
met only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in
more than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.
Even though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The
general first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials
in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama
looked "uncomfortable and intimidated" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the
Oval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. "It was a 10-minute
photo op," says an adviser to McChrystal. "Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy
who's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed."
From the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a
controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the
Pentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of
fighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the
enemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — a
process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially
rebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:
Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his
"surge" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.
Nicknamed "COINdinistas" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution
for Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.
As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists
in Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.
After arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary
Robert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another
40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of "mission failure."
The White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak
on national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was
determined to kick the president's ass.
Last fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in
Afghanistan. "I found that time painful," McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. "I was selling an
unsellable position." For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against
experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in
Afghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. "The entire
COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people," says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading
critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. "The idea that we are going to spend a trillion
dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.
In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the
president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic
crisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.

Then, without ever using the words "victory" or "win," Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops
to Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,
behind the counterinsurgency crowd.
Today, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.
In June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions
of dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.
troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that
began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it
as a "bleeding ulcer." In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and
Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The
president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even
though it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he
didn't want.
Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to
accomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. "It's not going to look like a win, smell
like a win or taste like a win," says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. "This is going
to end in an argument."
The night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists,
around the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she
has seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has
invited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the "least Gucci" place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised.
"He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear," she says with a laugh.
The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.
There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two
fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as
Team America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves
on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about
changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had
taken to deriding ISAF as short for "I Suck at Fighting" or "In Sandals and Flip-Flops.") McChrystal banned alcohol on
base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands
of officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub
modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary
for sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend
around the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a
staple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man
single-handedly winning the war.
By midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps
from a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own
invention."Afghanistan!" they bellow."Afghanistan!" They call it their Afghanistan song.
McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. "All these men," he tells me. "I'd die for them. And they'd die
for me."
The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group
represents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable
command of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an
assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special
Representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into
the mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call
the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. "It jeopardizes the mission,"
says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. "The military cannot
by itself create governance reform."
Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State
Department receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit
about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and
veteran of the Cold War, a "clown" who remains "stuck in 1985." Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,
"turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk
shows. Frankly, it's not very helpful." Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. "Hillary
had Stan's back during the strategic review," says an adviser. "She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'"
McChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. "The Boss says
he's like a wounded animal," says a member of the general's team. "Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
get fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp
onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit."
At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. "Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke," he groans. "I
don't even want to open it." He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in
his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.
"Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg," an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.
By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.
According to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and
2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by
NATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the
diplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively
increased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. "In reality, that position needs to be filled
by an American for it to have weight," says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.
The relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New
York Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's
strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as "not an adequate strategic partner," and cast doubt on whether the
counterinsurgency plan would be "sufficient" to deal with Al Qaeda. "We will become more deeply engaged here with no
way to extricate ourselves," Eikenberry warned, "short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and
chaos."
McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. "I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said
anything like that to us before," says McChrystal, who adds that he felt "betrayed" by the leak. "Here's one that covers his
flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'"
The most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not
diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead
Afghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered
credible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied
the president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.
In February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get
him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the
president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted
the aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.
This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government
puts us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his
cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. "He's been locked up in his
palace the past year," laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined
McChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.
soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. "General," he called out to McChrystal, "I didn't even know we were
fighting in Uruzgan!"
Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him
throughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all
joined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he
made no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a
fastball down the middle.
McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the
last to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The "Prison on the Hudson," as it was known then, was a
potent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,
and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called "rat fucking," which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or
mud, covered in shaving cream. "It was pretty out of control," says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to
serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls "huge talent" and
"wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism," also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.
forces in Iraq.
The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to
thrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more
than 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a
"century man." One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after
downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours
subjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. "I'd come visit, and I'd

end up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area," recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal
in 1973.
McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as
brilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary
magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his
career. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-
old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In "Brinkman's Note," a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator
appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the
assassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: "The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the
raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded."
After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. "We really
felt we were a peacetime generation," he recalls. "There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal."
So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental
commander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen
Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who
want to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers
outdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,
required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance
with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.
In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks
of humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as
a troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting
tossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that
followed September 11th. "He was very focused," says Annie. "Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he
wanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years."
By some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman
during the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander
with a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous "stuff happens"
remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission
Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —
overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part
in a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.
After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April
2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He
signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.
(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander
known for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,
specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. "If the circumstances of
Corporal Tillman's death become public," he wrote, it could cause "public embarrassment" for the president.
"The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions," wrote Tillman's mother,
Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the "golden
boy" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping
the chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.
Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in
Iraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of
abuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even
though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so
unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in
Afghanistan, viewing them as a "political swamp," according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for
his confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the
scandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in
Afghanistan.
The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a
dweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a "Jedi" commander, as Newsweek called
him. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor
rare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on
his iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name
and four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. ("There are no limits. There are only plateaus,
and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,
unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. "The fucking

lads love Stan McChrystal," says a British officer who serves in Kabul. "You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone
would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal."
It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite
forces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of
insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. "JSOC was a killing machine," says Maj. Gen.
Mayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist
networks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned
by the military. "The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,
sitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming," says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal
in Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. "He'd say, 'Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help.
You got to work together with these guys.'"
Even in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts
of a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from
four to 19. "You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight," McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the
hallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, "I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though." In fact, the general
frequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this
year, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created
tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special
Forces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests
erupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. "We've shot an amazing number of
people," McChrystal recently conceded.
Despite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that
the U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's "insurgent math," as he calls it — for every innocent person you
kill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air
power and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates
commanders responsible for civilian deaths. "For a while," says one U.S. official, "the most dangerous place to be in
Afghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident." The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make
not killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for "courageous restraint," a
buzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.
But however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own
troops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. "Bottom line?" says a former Special
Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. "I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of
engagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing."
In March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront
such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had
received an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.
"I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves," Arroyo
wrote.
Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: "I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers, as it is
something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend
upon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own." Then he showed up at Arroyo's
outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live
operation in a dangerous war zone.
Six weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-
old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED
a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general
would attend Ingram's memorial service. "He started to look up to you," Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to
make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.
The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM
to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard
towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen
some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had
repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a
combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been
denied. "These were abandoned houses," fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. "Nobody was coming back to live in them."
One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. "Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably
certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force," the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has
traveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't
have to make arrests. "Does that make any fucking sense?" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. "We should just drop a fucking
bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?"
The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of
command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. "Fuck, when I came over here and

heard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on," says Hicks, who has served three tours
of combat. "I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his
bird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they're all fucked up — either because
somebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this
thing."
McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two
dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. "I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all to
understand the big picture as well," McChrystal begins. "How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for
yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?" McChrystal says.
"Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir," says Hicks.
McChrystal nods. "Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead," he tells the men. "You're leading by example.
That's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside." Then he spends 20 minutes talking about
counterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,
but he's careful not to bullshit the men. "We are knee-deep in the decisive year," he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no
longer has the initiative — "but I don't think we do, either." It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning any
hearts and minds among the soldiers. "This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks," McChrystal tries to joke.
"But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies."
During the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use
lethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they
did in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban," one soldier says.
"Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing," McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't
kill your way out of Afghanistan. "The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work."
"I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir," the soldier persists. "You say we've stopped the momentum of the
insurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it's
getting."
"I agree with you," McChrystal says. "In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,
you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out
here and resettle it?"
A soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a
civilian. "That's the way this game is," McChrystal says. "It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll kill
all the shirts."
As the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one
last-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. "There's no way I can make that easier," he tells
them. "No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you're doing a great job.
Don't let the frustration get to you." The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold
President Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren't buying it.
When it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here
was Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.
The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent
memory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).
McChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,
expensive and easy to lose. "Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan," he says. But even if he somehow manages to
succeed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to
shut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,
roads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying
Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. "It's all very cynical, politically," says Marc Sageman, a former CIA
case officer who has extensive experience in the region. "Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there's nothing for us
there."
In mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by
Hamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in
Kabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the
praises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian
casualties. They mention the word "progress" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the •
session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. "There is no
denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economic
development," the president says. "As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been
visible just a few years earlier."
It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no
real progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. "It was one of our first
impressions," one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. "So many
lights shining brightly." So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
progress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have
mocked. "They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even
defined or recognizable," says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political
adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. "That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is
to create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become
great in the near future."
But facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those
closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things
are in Afghanistan. "If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,"
a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from
dreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its
counterinsurgency campaign even further. "There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next
summer if we see success here," a senior military official in Kabul tells me.
Back in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of "progress,"
McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning
to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original
home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that
McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more
groundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like
Fallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a "rising tide of security." The Afghan police and
army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city
to win over the civilian population.
Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. "This isn't a classic operation," says a
U.S. military official. "It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in." Other U.S. officials
insist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.
"The Taliban have a jackboot on the city," says a military official. "We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way
that doesn't alienate the population." When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders
say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.
"This looks like CT-plus!" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.
Whatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years
of war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that
COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his
influence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things
worse. "Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem," says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who
has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. "A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government
and creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility
among the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the
primary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using
the word "victory" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with
Stanley McChrystal in charge.

The Empty Chamber
Just how broken is the Senate?
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration....
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

Cit and watch us for seven days,"" one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. "You know what you'll see happening?
Nothing."

'This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'"
Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.
"It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. "The obstructionism has become
mindless."
The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly
behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and
top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.
"Also, it's a dumb rule in itself," McCaskill said. "It's time we started looking at some of these rules."
She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and
subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had
scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general
and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and McCaskill's
Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training of Afghan
police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a victory
ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-care
reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most embarrassing
sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who had fought the
bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.
So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard
Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. "I have no personal objection to
continuing," Burr said. But, he added, "there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object."
Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In
general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be
present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their first
look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The
presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce them to
the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about the
Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, "Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the
floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're
doing in China right now?"
Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name every
few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the press
lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of interest
actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers. On this
afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the transcription
machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate chamber is an
intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.
Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to
hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some
built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority
and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,
"Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and not
be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule."
The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon; the
general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators these
days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-term
successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.
Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three
amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an
amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch the
amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was to
finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the only
thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty
minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to
yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,
would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.
Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, "This is the first time in recent memory
that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to kill the
reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are defeated."
Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. "The position on the other side
of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good," he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose
half an octave. "Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015
inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an
inconvenience."
The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded
Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to
emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides the
chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third
person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the
moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's "Manual of
Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from insulting
any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting at Al
Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make no mistake, the intent
of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform. . . . A senator on
the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill health-care
reform!"
The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: "The time of the senator has expired."
For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that happens
on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the Democrats
while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that it wouldn't
have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had been designed to
make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically supports. One
amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on individuals making less
than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and outlandish. David Vitter, a
Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican
obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with mental illness would not be
denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists, and sex offenders" from
buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was allotted to explain his Viagra
amendment without cracking a smile. "This is not a game amendment," he insisted. "It actually saves money."
So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate," Baucus declared. "It is a crass
political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy." Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr.
Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues
milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John McCain—
now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed, trying to catch
the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben Nelson, of
Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.
The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled drone
was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, "Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!" Sporadically, a
sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could charm into
laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo animals—Levin a
shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one displayed a limited set of
behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and clamped his hands down on a
colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which senators were loners (Russ
Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which senators were important (Dick
Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).
Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through
her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. "Can we
get some order?" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It
was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.
Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,
unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was
hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the chamber
to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow, of Michigan,
her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion momentarily
eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face, as if casting
her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, "The longest it lasted was thirty seconds."
At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just found
two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the bill would
go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the Capitol's

northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty streets.
On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if waiting for
someone to take him away.
The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the
Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. "Everyone's
tired," Reid declared before the final vote. "This legislative fight is one for the record books." He was so fatigued that he
initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. "Way to go, Lindsey, way to
stretch it out," Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the losing
team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a moment the
chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.
The Senate is often referred to as "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, "That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of
exchange of ideas, is so limited." Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a
Republican and a Democrat. "The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring in
which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber."
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.
"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue," he said.
Instead, a senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets
up and gives a speech on a completely different subject." From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a
colloquy—"I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage
plan"—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits
from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.
Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same
morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a hearing
can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an unwritten
rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows senators to spend
four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their families in their
home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless fund-raising, and
to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, in 1995, he
told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader, said,
"When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one hundred senators there
was Wednesday afternoon."
Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, "Of any free time
you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own
campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on
behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate
office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee
Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, "It sucks up time that a
senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues."
In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took time
to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a million
dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry groups
were spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-raising
and lobbying, said, "People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The over-all bills
are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money."
Deschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: "Sometimes, you're dialling for dollars,
you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the floor, your
staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double check—but,
just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye vote, or a no
vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up sometimes. But, if
you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope nobody asks, because
I don't have a clue."
Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past few
decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff members,
who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional relationships, tend to
push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiating
the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox' or MSNBC.
One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. "You know about all
these rags that cover the Hill, right?" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily,
and CQ Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of
the "24/7 media," provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a "dust-up" between Scott

Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South Carolina;
the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront DeMint on the
Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators have a young
press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of political
obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go unreported
because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to the Senate in
1981 and will leave next January, told me, "I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who covered me on a
daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications only see me
through the prism of conflict." Lamar Alexander described the effect as "this instant radicalizing of positions to the left and
the right."
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly
fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan coOperation is still
permissible. "A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution," Gregg said. "Substantive,
thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside."
Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus lunch
to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one
another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses
who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill
Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall has
set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the
seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: "In those days Democrats and
Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim
DeMint, Dodd said, "Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well." He repeated something that Jon
Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: "There's no trust." Dodd, whose father was a senator,
went on, "That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with that
conclusion. And if that's missing.
There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party as
"friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as "one of my best friends in the Senate," and
both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with
Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udall
noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But opportunities to
bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the "inner sanctum," where
Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the seventies, old bulls
such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. "You
learned, and also you found out what was going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult to say crappy things about
someone that you just had lunch with." These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch in their
respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else "downtown," which means asking donors for money over
steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the "caucus lunch" was instituted by Republicans in
the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches work
members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry
Reid as an idiot. "At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors," Alexander joked, adding, "We spend most of
our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other."
In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind of dwindled off during the
health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few
months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.
These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers
who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson, of
Wisconsin, put it this way: "Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?"
The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.
The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a
levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply
impressed by the quality of its members: "They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous instincts
animating it, not the petty passions." But he also recognized that "a minority of the nation dominating the Senate could
completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the spirit of
constitutional government." As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented statesmen,
Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.
Robert A. Caro, in "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War •
the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster, Henry
Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the Presidencies of
Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of Southern racists

and Republican corporate shills, and was "the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed themselves in vain—
the chief obstructive force in the federal government." By the fifties, the Senate had become far more conservative than
the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book "Citadel," called the Senate "to a most peculiar
degree, a Southern Institution . . . growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly" and "the only place in the
country where the South did not lose the war."
By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and
Consent," based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works, in
its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-raisers,
no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere is
based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand. . . . They thrust hard
at one another in debate over serious matters," but, he writes, "understanding and accommodation in the ordinary course
of the Senate day was essential to sanity." Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the Senate to his
will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either "whales"—the heavyweight chairmen who
negotiated legislation—or "minnows," the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when, in 1958, a
formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, and Philip
Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of "The Fall of the House of
Roosevelt," worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. "They used to talk to each other—that's my most
vivid recollection," he said. "If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners would come in to
hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a deliberative body,
drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically." Senators who ran for office in order to work on foreign policy, social
welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. "But if you wanted to do something there was a mechanism
by which you could do it," Janeway said.
In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and
moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of
those decades as "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the
Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,
campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed
jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was passed,
in 1965, it won 70-24.
The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,
Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan "field
hearings" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,
greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's
legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and
said, "You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's
how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You should become Mr. Housing.
Housing is the future."
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and
accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of
people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs," Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled. "They
were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to
Republicans in the Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,
who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, "It was a huge loss of the most experienced,
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there
less than six years." He added, "The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets
worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others
didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'"
After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals
began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," a recent book by the Washington Post
reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans
began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan
coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own
fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members
of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to
regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in
the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and
escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats
filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-
called "nuclear option." Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went to

South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years
earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.
The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,
independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that every
election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The Senate,
no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main action was
between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican Senate
majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.
Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly
become populated by "ideologues and charlatans." He went on, "When we do get good people who come in, they very
quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay
there." He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with
angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about "pulling the plug on
Grandma." Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin "altering his behavior and abandoning
every issue, including campaign-finance reform."
One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.
A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the
111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger
down the list of senators. He did it again. "I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this." He
was stumped. "Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time." He
put the directory aside. "I'm just having the damnedest time."
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was hired
last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, until
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became lobbyists.
In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned and formed
a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a two-year
waiting period between serving and lobbying.
When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute
thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), and
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where
senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over
the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.
Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices," which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was
known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding
officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.
After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's "Advise and Consent" is still faintly visible. "The Senate, by its
nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's
not changed." Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its
members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, "To have a chamber
that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please."
In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one
(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia; liberals,
like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of
Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of
senior senators. "If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry is they won't stay. Because it's not
productive."
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in 6 dynamic new era. Instead, their
young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and "secret holds"—when a senator
anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire
McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds, and
Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical gamesmanship
between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first year. Michael
Bennet said, "We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small ones, and where
things have been put off for a really long period of time." He mentioned the national debt, energy policy, and the financial
crisis. "Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it."

We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with bottled
water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was moving.
Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already has to
defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to grow too
attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard. about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: "And then some
more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.' As the fifteen
months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems."
Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,
Con gressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his•state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office
maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent several
days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of unemployed
Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually, Republicans persuaded
Bunning to stop.)
These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,
Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In
2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more
senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and their party leader facilitates the game by
keeping their names secret.
Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of
partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-
authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used rule
that allowed the "previous question" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by the
eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and talking
until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster' comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for "looter.")
In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a "cloture" vote. For decades, the rule was rarely
used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies and
eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower the
threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a year, as
both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the Republicans lost
their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture votes in 2007 and
2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, the outraged
Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. "Because they do not do their business in a way that facilitates
noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate." Last week, six House
Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to run
the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection was
substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and vote.
Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading aloud
of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist; Senate
clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in frustration.
Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first
proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues "nihilists," who want to create chaos because it
serves their ideology. "If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't listen
to reason." McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican strategy
reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, "To the extent that they"—the Democrats—
"want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be helpful. To the
extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful."
One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after vote.
Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana; Susan
Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus? Alexander
said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, "When you have your back against the wall and the gallows
are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind."

Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: "He said
if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant." Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster a
military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad
Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with
the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose cloture,
and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)
Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus
bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-care-
reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against the
version that went before the full Senate. "I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance Committee
version—it grew by a thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White House officials
that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices, and said that the Democrats "did not
accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch." McConnell was able to exploit her
alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: "She actually said to me once that she had never felt
the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to her or quite as real or
troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this together. You're a senior
Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and you're going to do it.' "
Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the senator
who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverage
of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.
In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per cent
of the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a few new
senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.
Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent
time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.
"I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas," he said. "Then to be on the inside—the thing
that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show."
In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.
Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend
them, making it extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII is a Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different
idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that "each House may determine the Rules
of its Proceedings" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January and
propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority. There's
even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three times,
most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.
At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings
on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized working
groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee chairs by
caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were competing
for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other for Majority
Leader.)
For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. "If you want a
parliamentary form of government, go over to the House," Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. "Why even run for the
Senate?" Udall's plan for next January, he said, would be a "gigantic mistake."
"They'll get over it," Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. "And they'll get over it quicker if they're
in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider whatever they
have to say." He added that the Senate "may be getting done about as much as the American people want done." The
President's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of the Republicans I
spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is "broken." Alexander claimed that he and other Republicans were
exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate. "The Senate wasn't
created to be efficient," he argued. "It was created to be inefficient." At one of the filibuster hearings, in April, Alexander,
sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the Republicans with obstructing
legislation, "we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our right to debate, our right to offer
amendments, which is the essence of the Senate."

Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah Binder,
a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the filibuster, and
so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding of the freshmen,
"These are people who have never been in the minority." For older Democrats, who have put in their years, grown adept
at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat. (Among senior senators,
the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being divided not between
whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too accustomed to the Senate's
ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate Republicans are too weak to challenge the
newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,
wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" and "generous impulses" have no place.
A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial
regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to
pass a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.
The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first
term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of
Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having to
do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They worked
through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were members of
a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke, Alan
Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still
talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, they had finished
their work.
Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,
dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the
committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed
McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. "It was an odd place to be," Corker recalled. "And yet that night we
began meeting." The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In
response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their lobbyists
that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other Republicans of the
Party's line on financial reform.)
On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, "You've been a great
partner." He was ending their talks after only a month. "It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest," Corker told reporters
afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the
rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks
under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other
Republicans with him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-
five Republican votes."
The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar fund,
paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of another crisis.
But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was now parroting
talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a "partisan bill" that "will guarantee
perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks." McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-one Republicans,
suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded
with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, "Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the rhetoric.
Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do. . . . We were supposed to be
the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat down with cooler
heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot do that on
financial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it . . ." Corker didn't allow the
thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.
Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: "I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I am
not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue . . . then why

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015
are we even here?" He went on, "We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is looking out
for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority seems intent
on proving them right. . . . I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know there are friends
of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate, who want to be part of
the solution."
In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, "I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four or
five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it. . . . I have
to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!"
Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. "You and I went a long
way," Corker told Dodd. "Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats
on your committee."
"And I was not gaining Republicans," Dodd replied.
"You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did
not leave the table." Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few
days.
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-
reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists
prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the ornate
Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of furniture
scraping across a tile floor. "Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens around
here without a deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A few weeks
later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform finally came to a
vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He had even voted for
an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have scrapped Corker's work
of many months with Warner.
"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained
office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. "It's the Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy of obstruction
had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a "shrinking number" of Republicans were
frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, "God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking
member on this." Collins responded, "We could have had such a great time on this bill."
Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because "the American people don't trust either political party enough
to give them a blank check," was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. "There was zero
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes," he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the
bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, "If you want to vote against something, you
can always find your reasons."
But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating
himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of thirty
minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. "I am obviously disappointed," he said. "I think I have spent as
much time as any senator. . . on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good things in
it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not enough time
was spent on some of the core issues."
As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of "So Damn Much Money," in the press gallery. I later
asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of the
Senate. "If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away money
and interest groups," he said. "But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things
considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here
you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet."
After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,
smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, "For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it
didn't work." He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with "some Nevadans."
Durbin said, "I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?"
Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, "I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its
business much as our founders intended. We did that."
On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial
regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They
depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,
Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the year.
And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign finance,
transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial appointments on

the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you can feel the Senate
slipping back into stagnant waters.

The Political Scene
The Empty Chamber
Just how broken is the Senate?
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration....
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills
passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

""Sit and watch us for seven days," one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. "You know what you'll see happening?
Nothing."
"This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'"
Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.
"It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. "The obstructionism has become
mindless."
The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly
behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and
top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.
"Also, it's a dumb rule in itself," McCaskill said. "It's time we started looking at some of these rules."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and
subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had
scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general
and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and
McCaskill's Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training
of Afghan police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a
victory ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-
care reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most
embarrassing sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who
had fought the bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.
So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard
Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. "I have no personal objection to
continuing," Burr said. But, he added, "there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object."
Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In
general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be
present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their
first look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The
presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce
them to the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about
the Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, "Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the
floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're
doing in China right now?"
Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name
every few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the
press lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of
interest actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers.
On this afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the
transcription machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate
chamber is an intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.
Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to
hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some
built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority
and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,
"Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and
not be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule."
The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon;
the general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators
these days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-
term successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.
Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three
amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an
amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch
the amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was
to finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the
only thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty
minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to
yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,
would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.
Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, "This is the first time in recent
memory that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to
kill the reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are
defeated."

Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. "The position on the other side
of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good," he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose
half an octave. "Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an
inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an
inconvenience."
The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded
Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to
emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides
the chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third
person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the
moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's "Manual of
Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from
insulting any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting
at Al Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make no mistake, the
intent of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform.... A
senator on the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill
health-care reform!"
The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: "The time of the senator has expired."
For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that
happens on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the
Democrats while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that
it wouldn't have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had
been designed to make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically
supports. One amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on
individuals making less than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and
outlandish. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom
Coburn, a Republican obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with
mental illness would not be denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists,
and sex offenders" from buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was
allotted to explain his Viagra amendment without cracking a smile. "This is not a game amendment," he insisted. "It
actually saves money."
So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate," Baucus declared. "It is a crass
political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy." Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr.
Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues
milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John
McCain—now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed,
trying to catch the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben
Nelson, of Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.
The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled
drone was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, "Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!"
Sporadically, a sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could
charm into laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo
animals—Levin a shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one
displayed a limited set of behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and
clamped his hands down on a colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which
senators were loners (Russ Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which
senators were important (Dick Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).
Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through
her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. "Can we

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
get some order?" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It
was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.
Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,
unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was
hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the
chamber to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow,
of Michigan, her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion
momentarily eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face,
as if casting her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, "The longest it lasted was thirty
seconds."
At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just
found two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the
bill would go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the
Capitol's northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty
streets. On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if
waiting for someone to take him away.
The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the
Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. "Everyone's
tired," Reid declared before the final vote. "This legislative fight is one for the record books." He was so fatigued that he
initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. "Way to go, Lindsey, way
to stretch it out," Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the
losing team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a
moment the chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.
The Senate is often referred to as "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, "That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of
exchange of ideas, is so limited." Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a
Republican and a Democrat. "The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring
in which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber."
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.
"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue," he said.
Instead, a senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets
up and gives a speech on a completely different subject." From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a
colloquy—"I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage
plan"—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits
from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.
Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same
morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a
hearing can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an
unwritten rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows
senators to spend four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their
families in their home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless
fund-raising, and to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the
House, in 1995, he told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former
Democratic leader, said, "When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one
hundred senators there was Wednesday afternoon."
Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, "Of any free
time you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own
campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on
behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate
office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, "It sucks up time that a
senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues."
In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took
time to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a
million dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry
groups were spending $1.4 million.a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-
raising and lobbying, said, "People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The
over-all bills are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money."
Daschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: "Sometimes, you're dialling for
dollars, you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the
floor, your staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double
check—but, just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye
vote, or a no vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up
sometimes. But, if you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope
nobody asks, because I don't have a clue."
Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past
few decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff
members, who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional
relationships, tend to push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—
writing bills, negotiating the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox or MSNBC.
One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. "You know about all
these rags that cover the Hill, right?" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, CongressDaily,
and CO Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of
the "24/7 media," provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a "dust-up" between Scott
Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South
Carolina; the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront
DeMint on the Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators
have a young press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of
political obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go
unreported because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to
the Senate in 1981 and will leave next January, told me, "I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who
covered me on a daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications
only see me through the prism of conflict." Lamar Alexander described the effect as "this instant radicalizing of positions
to the left and the right."
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly
fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan cooperation is still
permissible. "A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution," Gregg said. "Substantive,
thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside."
Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus
lunch to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one
another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses
who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill
Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall
has set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the
seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: "In those days Democrats and
Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim
DeMint, Dodd said, "Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well." He repeated something that
Jon Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: "There's no trust." Dodd, whose father was a
senator, went on, "That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with
that conclusion. And if that's missing ... "
There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party
as "friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as "one of my best friends in the Senate,"
and both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining.
Udall noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But
opportunities to bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the "inner
sanctum," where Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the
seventies, old bulls such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan did. "You learned, and also you found out what was going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult to say
crappy things about someone that you just had lunch with." These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty.
Senators eat lunch in their respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else "downtown," which means
asking donors for money over steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the "caucus lunch"
was instituted by Republicans in the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980,
followed suit. Caucus lunches work members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican
lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry Reid as an idiot. "At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,"
Alexander joked, adding, "We spend most of our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other."
In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind of dwindled off during
the health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few
months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.
These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers
who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson,
of Wisconsin, put it this way: "Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?"
The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.
The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a
levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply
impressed by the quality of its members: "They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous
instincts animating it, not the petty passions." But he also recognized that "a minority of the nation dominating the
Senate could completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the
spirit of constitutional government." As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented
statesmen, Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.
Robert A. Caro, in "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War
the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster,
Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the
Presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of
Southern racists and Republican corporate shills, and was "the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed
themselves in vain—the chief obstructive force in the federal government." By the fifties, the Senate had become far
more conservative than the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book "Citadel," called the
Senate "to a most peculiar degree, a Southern Institution ... growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly"
and "the only place in the country where the South did not lose the war."
By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and
Consent," based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works,
in its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-
raisers, no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere is
based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand.... They thrust
hard at one another in debate over serious matters," but, he writes, "understanding and accommodation in the ordinary
course of the Senate day was essential to sanity." Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the
Senate to his will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either "whales"—the heavyweight
chairmen who negotiated legislation—or "minnows," the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when,
in 1958, a formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy,
and Philip Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of "The Fall of the
House of Roosevelt," worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. "They used to talk to each other—
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
that's my most vivid recollection," he said. "If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners
would come in to hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a
deliberative body, drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically." Senators who ran for office in order to work on
foreign policy, social welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. "But if you wanted to do something
there was a mechanism by which you could do it," Janeway said.
In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and
moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of
those decades as "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the
Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,
campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed
jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was
passed, in 1965, it won 70-24.
The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,
Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan "field
hearings" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,
greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's
legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and
said, "You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's
how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You should become Mr. Housing.
Housing is the future."
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and
accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of
people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs," Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled.
"They were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to
Republicans in the Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,
who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, "It was a huge loss of the most experienced,
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there
less than six years." He added, "The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets
worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others
didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'"
After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals
began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," a recent book by the Washington Post
reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans
began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan
coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own
fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members
of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to
regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in
the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and
escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats
filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-
called "nuclear option." Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went
to South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years
earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.
The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,
independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that
every election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The
Senate, no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main
action was between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican
Senate majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.
Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly
become populated by "ideologues and charlatans." He went on, "When we do get good people who come in, they very
quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
there." He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with
angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about "pulling the plug
on Grandma." Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin "altering his behavior and
abandoning every issue, including campaign-finance reform."
One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.
A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the
111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger
down the list of senators. He did it again. "I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this."
He was stumped. "Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time."
He put the directory aside. "I'm just having the damnedest time."
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was
hired last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, until
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became
lobbyists. In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned
and formed a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a
two-year waiting period between serving and lobbying.
When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute
thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), and
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where
senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over
the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.
Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices," which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was
known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding
officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.
After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's "Advise and Consent" is still faintly visible. "The Senate, by its
nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's
not changed." Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its
members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, "To have a chamber
that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please."
In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one
(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia;
liberals, like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of
Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of
senior senators. "If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry is they won't stay. Because it's
not productive."
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in a dynamic new era. Instead, their
young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and "secret holds"—when a senator
anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire
McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds,
and Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical
gamesmanship between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first
year. Michael Bennet said, "We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small
ones, and where things have been put off for a really long period of time." He mentioned the national debt, energy
policy, and the financial crisis. "Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it."
We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with
bottled water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was

moving. Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already
has to defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to
grow too attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: "And
then some more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.'
As the fifteen months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems."
Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,
CongressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office
maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent
several days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of
unemployed Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually,
Republicans persuaded Bunning to stop.)
These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,
Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In
2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more
senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and their party leader facilitates the game by
keeping their names secret.
Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of
partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-
authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used
rule that allowed the "previous question" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by
the eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and
talking until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster" comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for "looter.")
In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a "cloture" vote. For decades, the rule was
rarely used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies
and eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower
the threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a
year, as both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the
Republicans lost their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture
votes in 2007 and 2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills
passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, the
outraged Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. "Because they do not do their business in a way that
facilitates noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate." Last week, six
House Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to
run the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection
was substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and
vote. Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading
aloud of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist;
Senate clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in
frustration.
Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first
proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues "nihilists," who want to create chaos because
it serves their ideology. "If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't
listen to reason." McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican
strategy reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, "To the extent that they"—the

Democrats—"want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be
helpful. To the extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful."
One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after
vote. Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana;
Susan Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus?
Alexander said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, "When you have your back against the wall and
the gallows are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind."
Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: "He said
if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant." Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster
a military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad
Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with
the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose
cloture, and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)
Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus
bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-
care-reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against
the version that went before the full Senate. "I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance
Committee version—it grew by a thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White
House officials that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices, and said that the
Democrats "did not accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch." McConnell
was able to exploit her alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: "She actually said to me once
that she had never felt the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to
her or quite as real or troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this
together. You're a senior Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and
you're going to do it.'"
Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the
senator who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverage
of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.
In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per
cent of the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a
few new senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.
Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent
time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.
"I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas," he said. "Then to be on the inside—the
thing that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show."
In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.
Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend
them, making it extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII is a Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different
idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that "each House may determine the
Rules of its Proceedings" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January
and propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority.
There's even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three
times, most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.
At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings
on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized
working groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
chairs by caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were
competing for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other
for Majority Leader.)
For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. "If you want a
parliamentary form of government, go over to the House," Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. "Why even run for the
Senate?" Udall's plan for next January, he said, would be a "gigantic mistake."
"They'll get over it," Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. "And they'll get over it quicker if
they're in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider
whatever they have to say." He added that the Senate "may be getting done about as much as the American people
want done." The President's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of
the Republicans I spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is "broken." Alexander claimed that he and other
Republicans were exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate.
"The Senate wasn't created to be efficient," he argued. "It was created to be inefficient." At one of the filibuster
hearings, in April, Alexander, sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the
Republicans with obstructing legislation, "we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our
right to debate, our right to offer amendments, which is the essence of the Senate."
Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah
Binder, a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the
filibuster, and so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding of
the freshmen, "These are people who have never been in the minority." For older Democrats, who have put in their
years, grown adept at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat.
(Among senior senators, the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being
divided not between whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too
accustomed to the Senate's ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate
Republicans are too weak to challenge the newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,
wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" and "generous impulses" have no place.
A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial
regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to pass
a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.
The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first
term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of
Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having
to do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They
worked through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were
members of a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke,
Alan Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still
talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, they had finished
their work.
Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,
dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the
committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed
McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. "It was an odd place to be," Corker recalled. "And yet that night we
began meeting." The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In
response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
lobbyists that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other
Republicans of the Party's line on financial reform.)
On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, "You've been a great
partner." He was ending their talks after only a month. "It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest," Corker told reporters
afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the
rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks
under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other
Republicans with him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-
five Republican votes."
The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar
fund, paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of
another crisis. But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was
now parroting talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a "partisan bill"
that "will guarantee perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks." McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-
one Republicans, suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded
with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, "Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the
rhetoric. Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do.... We were
supposed to be the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat
down with cooler heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot
do that on financial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it ..." Corker didn't
allow the thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.
Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: "I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I
am not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue ... then
why are we even here?" He went on, "We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is
looking out for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority
seems intent on proving them right.... I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know
there are friends of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate,
who want to be part of the solution."
In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, "I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four
or five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it.... I
have to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!"
Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. "You and I went a long
way," Corker told Dodd. "Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats
on your committee."
"And I was not gaining Republicans," Dodd replied.
"You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did
not leave the table." Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few
days.
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-
reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists
prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the
ornate Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of
furniture scraping across a tile floor. "Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens
around here without a deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A
few weeks later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform
finally came to a vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He
had even voted for an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have
scrapped Corker's work of many months with Warner.

"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained
office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. "It's the Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy of obstruction
had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a "shrinking number" of Republicans were
frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, "God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking
member on this." Collins responded, "We could have had such a great time on this bill."
Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because "the American people don't trust either political party
enough to give them a blank check," was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. "There was zero
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes," he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the
bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, "If you want to vote against something,
you can always find your reasons."
But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating
himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of
thirty minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. "I am obviously disappointed," he said. "I think I have
spent as much time as any senator.
... on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good
things in it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not
enough time was spent on some of the core issues."
As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of "So Damn Much Money," in the press gallery. I
later asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of
the Senate. "If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away
money and interest groups," he said. "But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things
considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here
you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet."
After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,
smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, "For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it
didn't work." He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with "some Nevadans."
Durbin said, "I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?"
Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, "I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its
business much as our founders intended. We did that."
On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial
regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They
depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,
Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the
year. And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign
finance, transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial
appointments on the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you
can feel the Senate slipping back into stagnant waters.

Secretary Clinton may be one of the highest-profile attendees at Tuesday's Kabul Conference, but
Afghan women fear their opinions won't be heard—and they worry new deals with fighters will roll
back their hard-fought rights.
As Hillary Clinton prepares to attend Tuesday's Kabul Conference, Afghan women are delivering a plain message to
government and international officials: Women's voices should be heard.
""We have to be honest. With respect to the Kabul Conference, we have not been consulted," said Soraya Pakzad, founder
of a women's shelter in the western Afghan city of Herat. Her comment came during an unusually heated question-and-
answer session with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal and United Nations representative Staffan de
Mistura marking the end of a two-day women's conference. "We want to be involved in policy-making. We don't want our
presence to be purely symbolic."
"Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations or
accords."
The Kabul Conference is, in part, built on symbolism. A follow-up to January's London Conference, the gathering marks
the first time Afghanistan has played host to its international donors, a decision that is intended to showcase the transition
from foreign to Afghan ownership of national priorities. More than 65 international delegations are expected to descend
upon the Afghan capital, which is already enduring security crackdowns and traffic gridlock. Workers could be seen
Sunday painting curbs and planting flowers in advance of the foreigners' arrival.
Discussions will center around five topics, including economic development, agriculture, governance, and security. The
goal of the half-day event is to establish a framework for Afghan leadership in the setting—and execution—of the
country's political and economic direction.
•Ann Marlowe: The Republican Fight Over Afghanistan Although it remains to be seen how quickly the
Afghan government, long under-resourced and beset by allegations of corruption, will be able to take the reins from its
international donors, there is no question that Afghan ownership is the direction in which things are moving, on the
political, economic, and security fronts. And that is precisely why women feel the stakes for this week's meeting are so
high, particularly in light of new deals to empower local militias that might threaten women's rights.

"After the Kabul Conference, no one knows what else could be on the agenda apart from war escalations and
negotiations," said Orzala Ashraf, an Afghan human rights activist. "This is very important for us, to get a serious and
honest commitment from our government in the presence of all witnesses from the world that our voices will not be
silenced."
Ashraf and a number of other women's advocates view Tuesday's talks are their last, best shot at speaking out about their
concerns, with help from European and American officials who have been working hard to help them win a seat at the
table. In another show of support, Secretary Clinton and Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen will meet Tuesday
morning with a group of women leaders.
Regardless of this high-profile backing, many women say they have little faith in the process to produce anything aside
from more paper and more unkept promises.
"Women are very tired of all these conferences; the government is going to have to show commitments," said Selay
Ghaffar, an Afghan Women's Network board member. "We want things to change."
And it remains unclear how many Afghans outside Kabul, men or women, are paying attention to yet another gathering to
discuss their future.
"Women in the provinces don't even know about this," said Zainab, a young math teacher from Helmand province. "I
would say 60 percent of women have no idea this is going on."
Others say the presence of one or two women at the Kabul Conference isn't enough to make a difference. And they say
they fear the recent move from NATO to empower local militias to fight the Taliban, particularly in southern Afghanistan.
"This is very dangerous," said Shahida Hussain, a human rights advocate from Kandahar who worked as a community
organizer during the Taliban years. "We had militias during the communist years and Afghanistan was destroyed. We fear
war again."
Women leaders say that they want peace and are glad to welcome back former fighters, but only if they respect women's
constitutional guarantee to equal protections under the law.
"Women should be a constituent part of all bodies outlined in the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Plan," said the
women in a statement at the end of their meeting. "Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any
peace negotiations or accords."
In the meantime, women continue to fight for a voice as Tuesday approaches. After a weeklong flurry of conference calls,
embassy meetings, and lunchtime gatherings, two women aside from government ministers are now slated to speak.
And in a small victory for women, international officials agreed with Pakzad's assessment before pledging that women
would be more involved going forward.
"I agree, you were not consulted," said da Mistura, appearing to contradict the Afghan finance minister, who only a few
moments earlier had said that women's views had and would be included. "As usual, we have been paying lip service to
you and we are all at fault for that."

Soraya mentioned here is one of our Women of Courage. Gayle (the writer) told me in a separate email that De Mistura

pledged that the women would be more inovled in the follow up. He also told them that he was very impressed that
they had organized themselves in this 2-day conference to be able to play a more effective role. Zakhilwal was gracious,
but said they were adequately consulted. So it goes.

The Gates-Clinton axis
By: Ben Smith and Jen DiMascio and Laura Rozen
May 24, 2010 04:50 AM EDT
The White House likes to release images of President Barack Obama at the head of the
long Situation Room conference table, sober and experienced advisers lining either side.
But there is another meeting – with no cameras and no Obama – where the Cabinet's two
most formidable figures seek to put their own stamp on the administration's national
security agenda. It is the conversation Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton try to have each week when they're both in Washington, often in
the company of National Security Adviser Jim Jones.
In an administration dominated by a powerful White House staff, Clinton and Gates have
emerged as the giant exception and the only important center of gravity outside 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.
Their close relationship has been central to the unusual degree of agreement on critical
issues, most notably the Afghan surge but also a range of other initiatives, from increasing
the size of the State Department's foreign aid budget to imposing new sanctions on Iran.
""It's a phalanx," former Pentagon official Leslie Gelb said of the Clinton-Gates alliance. "I
can't remember a really important issue where they have disagreed. They are both center-
right; they have their four feet firmly planted on that ground. And that is, they are not going
to open themselves up to serious attack from the right, whether it's Iraq or Afghanistan or
Iran or you name it."
Gates, known inside the White House as "Yoda," is unquestionably the most powerful
member of the Obama Cabinet — the only one with the muscle to push back. Clinton,
meanwhile, is the most popular, her approval ratings cruising well above Obama's own.
An alliance is good for each of them.
Clinton saves Gates from political isolation as a Republican in a Democratic administration

and has signed on to a policy agenda he has set, adding her voice to his demands for
more troops and her department's civilian resources to the war in Afghanistan.
Gates, for his part, has saved Clinton from a different kind of marginalization by a powerful
White House staff, which has a sometimes-rocky relationship with her own staff of
loyalists, a residue of thebitter 2008 campaign. He's offered her a potent back channel to
power and — some of her most political allies have told other Democrats — a path
forward inside the administration.
Gates, who has long signaled an eagerness to retire, just launched what appears to be his
final initiative, a tough push to scale back the Pentagon's gargantuan bureaucracy.
Clinton, with her hawkish image and ties to Gates and to military brass, would be his most
logical successor — and some of her most senior allies have begun quietly to float the
notion.
The two meet regularly, though talk of weekly lunches was disrupted by the aggressive
travel schedules both keep. They most recently lunched together April 26 at the State
Department, a source said, but meet almost weekly, along with Jones, at the White
House. The two are said to be personally compatible. Both, one source noted, are
Midwestern United Methodists.
Connecticut Rep. John Larson, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said Gates
and Clinton have briefed the caucus three times together and present a united front. "The
overlap and the ease which they transition from point to point — very notable," he said.
"We have all Cabinet members move through the caucus. It's not always so notable that
they transition from point to point, seamlessly and are on the same page."
Such a close alliance between the two leading members of a modern president's Cabinet
is hardly typical.
"A lot of presidents have had to spend quite a bit of time adjudicating disputes between
the Pentagon and Foggy Bottom," said Strobe Talbott, a State Department official under
President Bill Clinton.
More often, they're fighting their own wars. Some of the deepest intramural hatreds in
American government have run across the Potomac, a tradition embodied most recently
by Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell, secretaries of defense and state in the
administration of President George W. Bush, who famously did not get along.
"My sense is that each of them understands the way in which the other one's function can
help advance the cause," said Talbott. "Bob Gates totally understands the need for a very
proactive and well-funded development policy in order to keep weak states from becoming
failed states."
The relationship is, indeed, part of a pattern for Gates, one that's made him one of the
most successful and enduring government officials of the past half-century. A career CIA
analyst who served as deputy national security adviser under Brent Scowcroft in the
George H.W. Bush White House before becoming the first career officer to lead the spy
agency, Gates spent 13 years in academia before being named Rumsfeld's successor in
2006.

Still, those who know Gates worried that after Obama made the, surprise decision to keep
him on at the Pentagon, he would inevitably be an outlier in a Democratic administration.
But the quick bond he formed with Hillary Clinton and others were part of a familiar
strategy.
"He's by nature an alliance builder," said a senior official from the Bush and Clinton
administrations.
Gates did not have a relationship with George W. Bush either when he took over from
Rumsfeld in 2006. But he had worked with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and
Stephen Hadley, Rice's successor as national security adviser during Bush's
administration. That helped him get along in the Cabinet, and he didn't stop there.
In contrast to Rumsfeld, who was dismissive of Capitol Hill, Gates courted key members
of Congress, particularly Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), the chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee. After Levin brought up concerns about confirming Marine Gen. Peter
Pace for a second two-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gates pulled
back on the nomination.
He has followed that pattern in the Obama administration. When Jones was taking knocks
in the press for being less powerful than his top deputies, Gates called on Washington
Post columnist David Ignatius, to defend Jones — a fellow supporter of the military and
someone in his age bracket — as "the glue that holds this team together," a dexterous bit
of politics that allowed him to do Jones a favor while simultaneous capitalizing on what's
perceived as his bureaucratic weakness.
Some of Gates's admirers see the relationship with Hillary Clinton in a similar light and
argue that he's been able to use her to achieve his policy goals — and not vice versa.
"The reality is that no one, including the White House, is willing to cross Gates because
we desperately need him for political cover on everything, whether it be defense budget
reform, arms control or[Afghanistan and Pakistan] and Iraq," a Democratic foreign policy
official said, challenging a reporter to "name me one issue where [Clinton] had a strong
viewpoint and then successfully maneuvered the administration in her direction."
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell dismissed the notion that Gates has used Clinton to
his advantage as "complete nonsense."
"Is this a mutually beneficial relationship? Sure, everyone benefits when the secretaries of
state and defense have a good working relationship. Are they using each other to advance
personal agendas? Absolutely not," he said. "They happen to be very like-minded on
many issues. She is, as he often says, very lough-minded' — and he respects that about
her. I know it's not very juicy, but there's no secret alliance here. The fact is they simply
see eye to eye more often than not."
Clinton, too, has experience in navigating the highest levels and of building unlikely
alliances.
"This replicates one of her most effective moves in the Senate, which was to figure out
who the power brokers were, study up on them and make sure she could work effectively
with them," said Heather Hurlburt, executive director of the National Security Network, a

Democratic group.
And if Gates has been a behind-the-scenes architect of policy, Clinton's role is more
public: She is "one of the articulators of the overall strategy that we adopted" on Iran and
China, Jones recently told Newsweek.
Some critics of Obama's policy, though, see the two hawks as having pulled the president
to the right. The two were particularly instrumental in making the case internally for an
Afghan troop surge, and they were close enough to sell it jointly, appearing together on
television to defend the plan.
Just last week, Clinton and Gates testified before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee to validate the administration's commitment to modernize the nation's nuclear
arsenal, and to preserve the ability to design new warhead components if needed.
The administration's stance was a victory for Gates, as the Pentagon appears to have
fought hard to keep the nuclear capacity — reportedly over the objections of other
members of the administration's inner circle, including Vice President Joe Biden.
Ironically, close observers say, the chief diplomat has emerged, if anything, as blunter and
more hawkish than the diplomatic secretary of defense. After an attempted bombing in
New York's Times Square appeared to have links to the Pakistani Taliban, Clinton publicly
warned of "very severe consequences" should an attack be traced back to Pakistan.
Gates took a far milder line.
"It's their country," he said. "They remain in the driver's seat, and they have their foot on
the accelerator." I

The political genius of supply-side economics

. ,zzq
1h. H)t!..re LH. oclic■/ was intensely debated in the FT last week. In this Exchange, I want to examine what is going on
in '.he ..tS and, in particular, what is going on inside the Republican party. This matters for the US and, because the US
remains the world's most important economy, it also matters greatly for the world.
My reading of contemporary Republican thinking is that there is no chance of any attempt to arrest adverse long-term
fiscal trends should they return to power. Moreover, since the Republicans have no interest in doing anything sensible, the
Democrats will gain nothing from trying to do much either. That is the lesson Democrats have to draw from the Clinton
era's successful frugality, which merely gave George W. Bush the opportunity to make massive (irresponsible and
unsustainable) tax cuts. In practice, then, nothing will be done.
Indeed, nothing may be done even if a genuine fiscal crisis were to emerge. According to my friend, 5rpc*. Uartiett, a
highly informed, if jaundiced, observer, some ""conservatives" (in truth, extreme radicals) think a federal default would be
an effective way to bring public spending they detest under control. It should be noted, in passing, that a federal default
would surely create the biggest financial crisis in world economic history.
To understand modern Republican thinking on fiscal policy, we need to go back to perhaps the most politically brilliant
(albeit economically unconvincing) idea in the history of fiscal policy: "supply-side economics". Supply-side economics
liberated conservatives from any need to insist on fiscal rectitude and balanced budgets. Supply-side economics said that
one could cut taxes and balance budgets, because incentive effects would generate new activity and so higher revenue.
The political genius of this idea is evident. Supply-side economics transformed Republicans from a minority party into a
majority party. It allowed them to promise lower taxes, lower deficits and, in effect, unchanged spending. Why should
people not like this combination? Who does not like a free lunch?
How did supply-side economics bring these benefits? First, it allowed conservatives to ignore deficits. They could argue
that, whatever the impact of the tax cuts in the short run, they would bring the budget back into balance, in the longer run.
Second, the theory gave an economic justification — the argument from incentives - for lowering taxes on politically
important supporters. Finally, if deficits did not, in fact, disappear, conservatives could fall back on the "starve the beast"
theory: deficits would create a fiscal crisis that would force the government to cut spending and even destroy the hated
welfare state.
In this way, the Republicans were transformed from a balanced-budget party to a tax-cutting party. This innovative stance
proved highly politically effective, consistently putting the Democrats at a political disadvantage. It also made the
Republicans de facto Keynesians in a de facto Keynesian nation. Whatever the rhetoric, I have long considered the US
the advanced world's most Keynesian nation — the one in which government (including the Federal Reserve) is most
expected to generate healthy demand at all times, largely because jobs are, in the US, the only safety net for those of
working age.
True, the theory that cuts would pay for themselves has proved altogether wrong. That this might well be the case was
evident: cutting tax rates from, say, 30 per cent to zero would unambiguously reduce revenue to zero. This is not to argue
there were no incentive effects. But they were not large enough to offset the fiscal impact of the cuts (see, on this,
Wikioedial and a nice chart from Paul Krugniarl
Indeed, Greg Mankiw, no less, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, has responded to
the view that broad-based tax cuts would pay for themselves, as follows: "I did not find such a claim credible, based on
the available evidence. I never have, and I still don't." Indeed, he has referred to those who believe this as "charlatans and
cranks". Those are his words, not mine, though I agree. They apply, in force, to contemporary Republicans, alas,

Since the fiscal theory of supply-side economics did not work, the tax-cutting eras of Ronald Reagan and George H. Bush
and again of George W. Bush saw very substantial rises in ratios of federal debt to gross domestic product. Under
Reagan and the first Bush, the ratio of public debt to GDP went from 33 per cent to 64 per cent. It fell to 57 per cent under
Bill Clinton. It then rose to 69 per cent gilder the second (
.
..73e
.proe Bush. Equally, tax cuts in the era of George W. Bush,
wars and the economic crisis account for almost all the dire fiscal outlook for the next ten years (see the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities).
Today's extremely high deficits are also an inheritance from Bush-era tax-and-spending policies and the financial crisis,
also, of course, inherited by the present administration. Thus, according to the international Monetary Fund the impact of
discretionary stimulus on the US fiscal deficit amounts to a cumulative total of 4.7 per cent of GDP in 2009 and 2010,
while the cumuiative deficit over these years is forecast at 23.5 cer cent of GDP. In any case, the stimulus was certainly
too small, not too large.
The evidence shows, then, that contemporary conservatives (unlike those of old) simply do not think deficits matter, as
former vice-president Richard Cheney is recorted to have tolo forme,. treasury secretary Paul O'Neill. But this is not
because the supply-side theory of self-financing tax cuts, on which Reagan era tax cuts were justified, has worked, but
despite the fact it has not. The faith has outlived its economic (though not its political) rationale.
So, when Republicans assail the deficits under President Ot.)ama, are they to be taken seriously? Yes and no. Yes, they
are politically interested in blaming Mr Obama for deficits, since all is viewed fair in love and partisan politics. And yes,
they are, indeed, rhetorically opposed to deficits created by extra spending (although that did not prevent them from
enacting the unfunded prescription drug benefit, under President Bush). But no, it is not deficits themselves that worry
Republicans, but rather how they are caused: deficits caused by tax cuts are fine; but spending increases brought in by
Democrats are diabolical, unless on the military.
Indeed, this is precisely what John Ky:Lo
...rizonal. a_senior Republican senalcr, has just said:
"[Ylou should never raise taxes in order to cut taxes. Surely Congress has the authority, and it would be
right to — if we decide we want to cut taxes to spur the economy, not to have to raise taxes in order to
offset those costs. You do need to offset the cost of increased spending, and that's what Republicans
object to. But you should never have to offset the cost of a deliberate decision to reduce tax rates on
Americans"
What conclusions should outsiders draw about the likely future of US fiscal policy? .
First, if Republicans win the mid-terms in November, as seems likely, they are surely going to come up with huge tax cut
proposals (probably well beyond extending the already unaffordable Bush-era tax cuts).
Second, the White House will probably veto these cuts, making itself even more Politically unpopular.
Third, some additional fiscal stimulus is, in fact, what the US needs, in the short term, even though across-the-board tax
cuts are an extremely inefficient way of providing it.
Fourth, the Republican proposals would not, alas, be short term, but dangerously long term, in their impact.
Finally, with one party indifferent to deficits, provided they are brought about by tax cuts, and the other party relatively
fiscally responsible (well, everything is relative, after all), but opposed to spending cuts on core programmes, US fiscal
policy is paralysed. I may think the policies of the la L::
.._:agvernscei:jt dangerously austere, but at least it can act.
This is extraordinarily dangerous. The danger does not arise from the fiscal deficits of today, but the attitudes to fiscal
policy, over the long run, of one of the two main parties. Those radical conservatives (a small minority, I hope) who want
to destroy the credit of the US federal government may succeed. If so, that would be the end of the US era of global
dominance. The destruction of fiscal credibility could be the outcome of the policies of the party that considers itself the
most patriotic.
In sum, a great deal of trouble lies ahead, for the US and the world.

ith a victory like this..
The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians
have preconditions - dictated by Israel.
By At.tiye Elder: Tags: Israel news M:ddist East peace
Two years ago, a basketball tournament was held at Tel Aviv University with the participation of student teams from 14
cOuntries, including a Palestinian team from the occupied territories. The games were purportedly held ""without
preconditions," and every team put its best players on the court and aimed to win.
But unsurprisingly, the Shin Ben security service permitted only seven Palestinian players, including bench players, to
enter Israel. Some of the key players on the team were compelled to stay at home. After several losses (by 30 to 40
points), when it was the Palestinians turn to face a team from one of the Israeli colleges, their coach announced that he
had decided to spare his players another humiliation, and requested that the game be canceled.
The illuminating movie "Friendship Games," to be shown tonight on the Yes Docu channel (directed by Ram Levy, along
with Ibtisam IVIara'ana, Duki Dror and Yoav Shamir), documents the tournament, which was the initiative of Ed Peskowitz,
an American Jew and co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team in the NBA. The camera follows the Israeli coach to
the Palestinian locker room. After a long while, he tells his players that in order to even out the teams, two of them will join
the other side. He tells two of the Israeli bench players, including one known as Fats(); to don the shirts of the Palestinian
team. The game ends with a decisive victory for the Israeli team and a strong sense of missed opportunity..
The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, like the basketball game, have preconditions. Not the
conditions demanded by the Palestinians, but conditions dictated by Israel. The refusal to freeze Israeli building in East
Jerusalem is a precondition, just like the demand to freeze it. The refusal to resume negotiations from the point where
talks between the previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left off after the
Annapolis conference is no less a precondition than the demand to resume talks from square one.
The head referee, the president of the United States, has twisted the arms of his colleagues in the Quartet and is dragging
Abbas to Washington. Barack °barna decided that the negotiations will be held without any commitment regarding
building in East Jerusalem, and will be opened without even a declaration of principles stating that the talks will be held on
the basis of a general formula, like peace and security for Israel and a state along the 1967 borders for the Palestinians.
It's time to jump into the fountain in Rabin Square and cheer: The Palestinians have been shafted!
If Benjamin Netanyahu's aim is to play around as much as possible with the ball, and sometimes kick the opponent, then
he can really chalk up another victory. But Israel's success in the negotiations, like the success of the student team in the
tournament, is not measured by the terms "victory" or "defeat." What is victory over a weak Palestinian team worth, if it
was won in friendly games that ended with virtually no interaction between the participants? What is a political process
with the Palestinians worth if it erodes Abbas' standing and leads nowhere?

What have we to gain from humiliating our partner before his constituency on the way to the negotiating table? If Israel's
approach on every one of the core issues is that winning is everything, there's no point in bothering so many VIPs with
another unnecessary summit. Let's assume that we'll succeed, with the help of the Jewish power around Obama, to twist
Abbas' arm some more and extract, for example, an agreement in which he concedes sovereignty over the Temple
Mount. How many hours would such an agreement last?
All we need is a few more "victories" like the invitation to the launch of direct negotiations, "without preconditions," and
we'll lose our last partners to a settlement that will prevent Israel from turning into an apartheid state or a Palestinian state
(the binational model is a nightmare, as far as I'm concerned).
What will we do if Abbas announces that he's had enough of losing in purportedly friendly games, and that he's decided
the time has come to step down? Will we declare another victory and invite Hamas leader Khaled Meshal and Iranian
president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the party?

COVERT OPERATIONS
The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.
by Jane Mayer
<http://www.newYo com/magazi ics/jane mayer,_,earc ?contributorName=ane%20maver>
AUGUST 30, 2010
David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and
have quietly given more than a hundred million dollars to right-wing causes.
On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a
tall, jovial-looking billionaire took the stage. It was the seventieth annual
spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated
for his generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated
$2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season, and had given many millions
before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's
co-chairs, Blaine Trump, in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had
been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth

Avenue apartment that Koch had bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years
later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.
The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has
become one of the city's most prominent philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a
hundred million dollars to modernize Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre
building, which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American
Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is named for him. This spring,
after noticing- the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, Koch pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation.
He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in the
city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where,
after he donated more than forty million dollars, an endowed chair and a
research center were named for him.
One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary
co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office said that a scheduling conflict had
prevented her from attending. Yet had the 'First Lady shared the stage with Koch
it might have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as
part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth attacks on the federal
government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.
With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of
Koch Industries, a conglomerate, headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, whose annual
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has grown
spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took
charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and
control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper
towels, Dixie cups, Georgia-ea ific lumber, Stainmaster carpet, and Lycra, among
other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest private company in the
country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and
Charles Koch—who, years ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest men
in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is exceeded
only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal
' and corporate taxes, minimal social services for the needy, and much less
oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail
with the brothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute
named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States. And
Greenpeace issued a report identifying the company as a "kingpin of climate
science denial." The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly
outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related
to climate change, underwriting a huge network of foundations, think tanks, and
political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
against so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the
economic-stimulus program—that, in political circles, their ideological network
is known as the Kochtopus.
In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report "distorts the
environmental record of our companies." And David Koch, in a recent, admiring
article about him in New York, protested that the "radical press" had turned his
family into "whipping boys," and had exaggerated its influence on American
politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, a
. nonpartisan watchdog group, said, "The Koons are on a whole different level.
There's no one else who has spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is
what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political
manipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've
never seen anything like it. They are the Standard Oil of our :times."
few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for
Prosperity Foundation—an organization that David Koch started, in 2004—held a
different kind of gathering. Over the July
. 4th weekend, a summit called Texas
Defending the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin.
Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures, he did not attend the
summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was
roused not by a dance performance but by a series of speakers denouncing
President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit, warned that
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Administration officials "have a socialist vision for this country."
Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training
session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An advertisement cast the event as a
populist uprising against vested corporate power. "Today, the voices of .average
Americans are being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests," it said.
"But you can do something about it:" The pitch made no mention of its corporate
funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have
largely eluded public notice. David Axelrod, Obama'-s senior adviser, said, "What
they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought
to you by a bunch of oil billionaires."
In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson, denied that the Kochs
had direct links to the Tea. Party, saying that Americans for Prosperity is "an
independent organization and Koch. companies do not in any way direct their
activities." Later, she issued a statement: "No funding has been provided by
Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or David Koch specifically
to support the tea parties." David Koch told New York; "I've never been to a
tea-party event. No one representing the tea party has ever even approached me."
At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable-a longtime political operative who
draws a salary from Americans for Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded
political groups since 1994-spoke less warily. "We love what the Tea Parties are
doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!" she declared, as

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
the crowd cheered. In a subsequent interview, sh described herself as an early
member of the movement, joking, "I was part of the Tea Party before it was
cool!" She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help
"educate" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give them "next-step
training" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be
channelled "more effectively." And she noted that Americans for Prosperity had
provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said
of the Kochs, "They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board.
I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative of what they do."
Venable honored several Tea Party "citizen leaders" at the summit. The Texas
branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its Blogger of the Year Award to a young
woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama
as the "cokehead in chief." In an online thread, West speculated that the
President was exhibiting symptoms of "demonic possession (aka schizophrenia,
etc.)." The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the
actress best known for her role on the television series "Northern Exposure."
She declared, "They don't want our children to know about their rights. They
don't want our children to know about a God!"
During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general
of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama was "the most radical President ever to

government taking over our economy and our lives." Countering °barna, Cruz
proclaimed, was "the epic fight. of our generation!" As the crowd rose to its
feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: "Victory,
or death!"
Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the
movement's inception. In the weeks before the first Tax Day protests, in April,
2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters "Tea Party
Talking Points." The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the
Missouri branch urged members to sign up for "Taxpayer Tea Party Registration"
and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the
rebellion. The North Carolina branch recently launched a "Tea Party Finder" Web
site, advertised as "a hub for all the Tea Parties in North Carolina."
The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elect-ions represents a political
triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to "educate," fund, and organize Tea
Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass
movement. Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once
worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based think tank
that the Kochs fund, said, "The problem with the whole libertarian movement is
that it's been all chiefs and no Indians. There haven't been any actual people,
.like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been
trying to create a movement." With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
"everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there are Indians out
there—people who can provide real ideological power." The Kochs, he said, are
"trying to shape and control and channel the populist uprising into their own
policies."
A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and
David Koch said of the Tea Party, "The Koch brothers gave the money that founded
it. It's like they put the seeds in the around. Then the rainstorm comes, and
the frogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!"
The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews.
Instead, a prominent New York public-relations executive who is close with the
Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York,
and Mortimer Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a
Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch, called him "a
patriot who cares deeply about his country." Zuckerman praised David's "gentle
decency" and the "range of his public interests."
The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities,
"To call them under the radar is an understatement. They are underground!"
Another former Koch adviser said, "They're smart: This right-wing, redneck stuff
works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty.
themselves." Rob Stein, a Democratic political strategist who has studied the
conaervative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are "at the epicenter of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

the anti-Obama movement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the
same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill Clinton. They are out to
destroy progressivism."
ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to
Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch printer who settled in Texas and
ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended PLI.T., where he earned a degree in
chemical engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for
converting oil into gasoline, but, according to family lore, America's major oil
companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to
succeed at home, Koch found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties,
his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regime set up
fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged
several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch was deeply affected by the experience,
and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of
his company, Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed
at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had•been destroyed in the Second
World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, "As the
Soviets became a stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at
having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot."
In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the John Birch Society,
the arch-conservative group known, in part, for a highly skeptical view of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered
President Dwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published
broadside, Koch claimed that "the Communists have infiltrated both the Democrat '
and Republican Parties." He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression
of Communists in Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement.
"The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take over America," he
warned. Welfare was.a secret blot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they
would foment "a vicious race war." In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea
Party's talk of a secret socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would
"infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is
a Communist, unknown to the rest of us:"
Koch tarried Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had
four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins, David and William. John Damgard, the
president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and
friend. He recalled that Fred Koch was "a real John Wayne type." Koch emphasized
rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in Africa, and requiring them
1-o do -Farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a
large compound across from Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could
hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed to join
them. "By instilling a work ethic in me at an early age, my father did me a b
favor, although it didn't seem like a favor back then," Charles has written. "By
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time." David
Koch recalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. "He was
constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong with government," he
told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author
of "Radicals for Capitalism," a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. "It's
something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big government was
bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes
was not good."
David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to
military school. Charles, David, and William all earned engineering degrees at
their father's alma meter, M.I.T.,, and later joined the family company. Charles
eventually assumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the
company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and studied playwriting at
the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished
him financially. (Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this.)
In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business
Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred Koch's will made his sons
extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003
speech to alumni at Deerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million •
dollars, he was made the school's sole "lifetime trustee." He said, "You might
ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let

me tell you a story. It all, started when I was a little boy. One day, my father
gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold
them for ten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this
went on day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year,
until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!"
David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they
did not share all his views, according to diZerega, who befriended Charles in
the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society
bookstore in Wichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to
participate in an informal political-discussion group. "It was pretty clear that
Charles thought some of the Birch .Scciety was bullshit," diZerega recalled.
DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandoned right-wing
views, and became a political-science professor. He credits Charles with opening
his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles
is one of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega
believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward intellectual trajectory,
transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the
U.S. government, and seeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a
tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega writes,
"As state socialism failed . . . the target for many within these organizations
shifted to any kind of regulation at all. 'Socialism' kept being defined
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
downwards."
Members• of the John Birch Society developed an interest in a school of Austrian
economists who promoted free-market ideals. Charles and David Koch were
particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of "The
Road to Serfdom" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led,
inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek's belief in unfettered capitaiisth has
proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents;
lately, Tea Party supporters have championed his work. In June, the talk-radio
host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted "The Road
to Serfdom" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on
Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the Kochs; in the midst of a recent on-air
parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, "I want to thank Charles Koch
for this information." Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)
Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert
LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state but didn't like the label
"anarchist"; he called himself an "autarchist." LeFevre liked to say that
"government is a disease masquerading as its own cure." In 1956, he opened an
institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian Doherty, of
Reason, told me that "LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart,"
and that the school was "a tiny world of people who thought the New Deal was a
horrible mistake." According to diZerega, Charles supported the school
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
financially, and even gave him money to take classes there.
Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries.
In 1980, William, with assistance from Freddie, attempted to take over the
company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In
retaliation, the company's board, which answered to Charles, fired William.
("Charles runs it all with an iron hand," Bruce Bartlett, the economist, told
me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and
David on the other.. In 1983, Charles and David bought out their brothers' share
in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained, and
litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival
private investigators; in 1990, they walked past one another with stony
expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually, Freddie moved to Monaco,
which has no income tax. He bought historic estates in France, Austria, and
elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary
manuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to
yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five million dollars to win the America's
Cup, in 1992.
With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded
.
rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the investment-banking firm Evercore, told me
that the company's performance has been "beyond phenomenal." Charles remained in
Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
community charities. David moved to New York City, where he is an executive
vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A
financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, "Charles is the
company. Charles runs ." David, described by associates as "affable" and "a
bit of a lunk," enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a
yacht in the South of France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where
he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened to an "East
Coast version of Hugh Hefner's soirees." In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a
fashion assistant. They live in a nine-thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park
Avenue, with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan,
and more genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both
brothers, couldn't think of a single issue on which the brothers disagreed.
As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters
of hard-line libertarian politics in America. Charles's goal, as Doherty
described it, was to tear the government "out at the root." The brothers' first
major public step came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine,
to run for public office. They had become supporters of the Libertarian Party,
and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against
Ronald Reagan from the right. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign
donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential
•
slot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
as he wished on the campaign. The ticket's slogan was "The Libertarian Party has
only one source of funds: You." In fact, its primary source of funds was David
Koch, who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.
Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party
movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that libertarians were getting ready to stage
"a very big tea party," because people were "sick to death" of taxes. The
Libertarian Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the
° .C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social
Security, minimum-wage laws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income
taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs, and
suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of
individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a more traditional conservative,
called the movement "Anarcho-Totalitarianism."
That November,. the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote.
The brothers realized that their brand of politics didn't sell at the ballot
box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. •"It tends to
be a nasty, corrupting business," he told a reporter at the time. "I'm
interested in advancing libertarian ideas." According to Doherty's book, the
Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely "actors playing out a
script." A longtime confidant of the Kochs told Doherty that the brothers wanted
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
to "supply the themes and words for the scripts." In order to alter the
direction of America, they had to "influence the areas where policy ideas
percolate from: academia and think tanks."
fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena.
But they poured more than a hundred million dollars into dozens of seemingly
independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch
family foundations gave money to thirty-four political and policy organizations,
three of which they founded, and several of which they direct. The Kochs and
their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy
groups, and lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled
suspicion on the 'left; Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress, has called
the Kochs "the billionaires behind the hate."
Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have Spent on politics. Public tax
records show that between 1998 and 2008 the Charles G. Koch Charitable
Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe
Charitable Foundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his slife, along
with two company employees and an accountant, spent more than twenty-eight
million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and
twenty million. Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty
million dollars. on lobbying. Separately, the company's political-action
committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
campaigns, more than eighty per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch
Industries leads all other energy companies in political contributions, as it
has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other
family members have personally spent more than two million dollars on political
contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David Koch was the biggest
individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a
million-dollar donation. Other gifts by the Koons may be untraceable; federal
tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically active nonprofit
groups.
In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of
their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In the nineteen-eighties, the Olin
family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for
funding right-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And
during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of Andrew Mellon, spent
millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt,
vice-president at the Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the
Kochs' effort is unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal funds:
"Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering."
Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier
George Soros, runs a foundation, the Open Society Institute, that has spent as
much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
generous private contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including
Obamas. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that Soros's giving is
transparent, and that "none of his contributions are in the service of his own
economic interests." The Kochs have given millions of dollars to nonprofit
groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for
industry. Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful
idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a rationale for
corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, "Perhaps he has confused making
money with freedom."
Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose
of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable foundations must conduct exclusively
nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the
National Committee for *Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the
*Kochs' foundations as being self-serving, concluding, "These foundations give
money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that
impact the profit margin of Koch Industries."
The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding
'organizations that aim to push the country in a libertarian direction. Among the
institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice,. which
files lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane
Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and the Bill of Rights
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Institute, which promotesa conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the
organizations funded by the Kochs employ specialists who write position papers
that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has
acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. "If we're going
to give a lot of money, we'll make darn sure they spend it in a way that goes
along with our intent," he told Doherty. "And if they make a wrong turn and
start doing things we don't agree with, we withdraw funding."
he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the
.vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that Lewis Powell, then a Virginia
attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The
antiwar movement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow
Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest crusade against
corporations. Powell, writing- a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged
American companies to fight back. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he
warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, respectable elements of
soCiety"—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote,
business leaders needed to wage a long-term, unified campaign to change public
opinion.
Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the
deliberation of an engineer. "To bring about social change," he told Doherty,
requires "a strategy" that is "vertically and horizontally integrated," spanning
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
"from idea creation to policy development to education to grassroots
organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action." The project, he
admitted, was extremely ambitious. "We have a radical philosophy," he said.
In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian
think tank, the Cato Institute. According to the Center for Public Integrity,
between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the
institute. Today, Cato has more than a hundred full-time employees, and its
experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the mainstream
media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been
critical of both parties. Put it has consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts,
reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.
When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming
as "beyond dispute," the Cato Institute took out a full-page ad in the Times to
contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political
attempts to stop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed
Crane, the Cato Institute's founder and president, told me that "global-warming
theories give the government more control of the economy."
Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate
scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climate scientists at the University of
East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared
to suggest a willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went public, one Cato
scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal.
But five independent inquiries have since exonerated the researchers, and
nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus
on global warming.
Nevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate
change. Even though the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently
issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal,
more Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have
exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The Kochs promote this statistic
on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has
played in fostering such doubt.
In a 2002 memo; the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that.so
long as "voters believe there is no consensus about global warming within the
scientific community" the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of
environmental reform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations
strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to forestall
regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental Skepticism, such
as the Heritage Foundation, which has argued that "scientific facts gathered in
the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming."
The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Independent Women's Forum, which opposes the presentation of global warming as a
scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by
Nancy Pfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a
vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group's board.
Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of
California, San Diego, is the co-author of "Merchants of Doubt," a new book that
chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on
science. She noted that the Mocha, as the heads of "a company with refineries
and pipelines," have "a lot at. stake." She added, "If the answer is to phase out
fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we
shouldn't be surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail."
David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been
caused by human activity. Even if it has been, h said, the heating of the
planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern
Hemisphere. "The Earth will be able to support enormously more peoplebecause
far greater land area will be available to produce food," he said.
n the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason
University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up another think tank. Now known as
the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as "the world's premier university.
source for market-oriented ideas—bridging the gap betWeen. academic ideas and
teal-world problems." Financial records show that the Koch family foundations

have contributed more than thirty million dollars to George Mason, much of which
has gone to the Mercatus Center, a nonprofit organization. "It's ground zero for
deregulation.policy in Washington," Rob Stein, the Demodratic strategist, said.
It is an unusual arrangement. "George Mason is a public university, and receives
public funds," Stein noted. "Virginia is hosting an institution• that the Kochs
practically control."
The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink
heads Koch Industries' lobbying operation in Washington. In addition, he is the
president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of the
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R.
Koch Foundation, and a director and co-founder, with David Koch, of the
Americans for Prosperity Foundation.
Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the
Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed Crane, the 'head or the Cato
Institute, as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on
the board at Cato, Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested
to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's management
philosophy, which he distilled into a book called "The Science of Success," and
trademarked under the name Market-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book,
Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the
competitiveness of the marketplace. Koch describes M.B.M. as a "holistic system"

containing "five dimensions: vision, virtue and talents, knowledge.processes,
decision rights and incentives." A top Cato Institute official told me that
Charles "thinks he's a genius. He's the emperor, and he's convinced he's wearing
clothes." Fink, by contrast, has been .far more embracing of Charles's ideas.
(Fink, like the Kochs, declined to be interviewed.)
At a 1995 conference for philanthropists, Fink adopted the language of economics
when speaking about the Mercatus Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers
should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw
materials into policy "products."
The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center "the mos.t important think
tank you've never heard of," and noted that fourteen of the twenty-three
regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a "hit list" had been
suggested first by Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have
"other means of fighting [their] battles," and that the Mercatus Center does not
actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law
professor at the University of Texas, who specializes in environmental issues,.
told me that "Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., and Mercatus
has constantly hammered on the agency." An environmental lawyer who has clashed
with the Mercatus Center called it "a means of laundering economic aims." The
lawyer explained the strategy: "You take corporate money and give it to a
neutral-sounding think tank," which "hires people with pedigrees and academic

degrees who put out credible-seeming studies. But they all coincide perfectly
with the economic interests of their funders."
In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of
pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oil refineries. Susan Dudley, an
economist. who became a top official at the Mercatus Center, criticized the
proposed
. rule. The E.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free
skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that if pollution
were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin
cancer each year.
In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took up Dudley's smog argument.
Evaluating the E.P.A.rule, the court found that the E.P.A. had "explicitly
disregarded" the "possible health benefits of ozone." In another part of the
opinion, the court ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in
calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional Accountability
Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously
attended legal junkets, on a Montana ranch, that were arranged by the Foundation
for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family
foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their
attendance.
deas don't happen on their own," Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, a
Tea Party advocacy group, told me. "Throughout history, ideas need patrons." The

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that think
tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver
those ideas to the street, and•to attract the public's support. In 1984, David
Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization, and Kibbe joined them.
The group, Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but
according to the Center for Public Integrity it was sponsored principally by the
Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 1993. Its mission, Kibbe said,
"was to take these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America. . . . We
read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent revolutions—Saul Alinsky,
Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an
example of nonviolent, social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to
sell ideas, not candidates." Within a few years, the group had mobilized fifty
paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs'
agenda. David and Charles, according to one participant, were "very controlling,
very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it."
Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate
Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated their business and released a
scathing report accusing Koch Oil of "a widespread and sophisticated scheme to
steal crude oil from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring." The
Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one million dollars' worth
of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee •

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
investigators that oil measurement is "a very uncertain art."
To defend its reputation, Koch Industries hired Robert Strauss, then a premier
Washington lobbyist; the company soon opened an office in the city. A grand jury
was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded,
without issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the
committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal lives of committee
staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the
Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Ballen, the counsel to the Senate committee, said,
"These people have amassed such unaccountable power!"
By 1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had
become a prototype for the kind of corporate-backed opposition campaigna that
have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on
Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running- advertisements,
staging media events, and targeting opponents. And it mobilized anti-tax rallies
outside the Capitol-rallies that NPR described as "designed to strike fear into
the hearts of wavering Democrats." ban Glickman, a former Democratic congressman
from Wichita, who supported the B.T.U. tax, recalled, "I'd been in Congress
eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent.
They used a lot of resources and effort-their employees, too." Glickman suffered
a surprise defeat. "I can't prove it, but I think I was probably their victim,"
he said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations
with generic-sounding names, and this made it difficult to ascertain the extent
of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created
a spinoff group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other
environmental problems "myths." When the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated
the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had "no citizen membership of
its own."
In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report
called "an audacious plan to pour millions of dollars in contributions into -
Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source," in
order to evade .campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had
paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in twenty-six House races
and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an
obscure nonprofit group, the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's
minority report suggested that "the trust was financed in whole or in part by
Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas." The brothers were suspected of
having secretly paid for the attack ads, most of which aired in states where
Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially
active, the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races.
The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the money, refused to
comment. In 1998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
on the Kochs' payroll had been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the
Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as "historic. Triad was the
first time a major corporation used a cutout"—a front operation—"in a
threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of a company run amok."
uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny
and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice Department filed two lawsuits
against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three
hundred oil spills, which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil
into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two hundred and
fourteen million dollars. In a settlement, Koch Industries paid a record
thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to spend five million dollars on
environmental projects.
In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the
deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion that resulted from a leaky
underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed
settlement.) And in the final months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice
Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for
covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its
refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company was liable for three hundred and
fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five
years in prison. The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including the
falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David
Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time, headed the environmental-crimes
section at the Justice Department, described the suit as "one of the most
significant cases ever brought under the Clean Air Act." He added,
"Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,
and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both."
During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred
thousand dollars to support the candidacies of George N. Bush and other
Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel
companies enjoyed remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary
Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered enormous subsidies
and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit
hawks, but, according to a study by Media Matters, their companies have
benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since
2000.
In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its
weight behind Bush's reelection. The group's Oregon branch had attempted to get
Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support
for John Kerry, Critics argued that it was illegal for a tax-exempt nonprofit
organization to donate its services for partisan political purposes. (A
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)
That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the
organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink started a new group, Americans
for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political
veteran who had worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican
activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-consulting company that
became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
Phillips's online biography describes him as an expert in "grasstops" and
"grassroots" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an
even greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known
for praising "throat slitters" in politics, called Phillips "a grownup who can
make things happen."
Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had
only eight thousand registered members. Currently, its Web site claims that the
group has "1.2 million activists." Whatever its size, the Kochs' political
involvement has been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me
that Americans for Prosperity "was micromanaged by the Kochs." And the brothers'
investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the
•
family's other organizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama
Presidency.
In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
could be on the verge of "the greatest loss of liberty and prosperity since the
1930s." That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative
operatives at a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the
editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern, thanked
David Koch, and vowed to "unite and fight . . . the armies of the left!" Soon
after Obama assumed office, Americans for Prosperity launched "Porkulus" rallies
against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a
report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward
Democratic districts; eventually, the author was forced to correct the report,
but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing the paper, had labelled Obama's program "a
slush fund," and Fox News and other conserVative outlets had echoed the
sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for
Prosperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at
Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)
Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which
organized what Phillips has estimated to be more than three hundred rallies
against health-care reform. At one rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman
was hung; at another, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from
Dachau. The group also helped organize the "Kill the Bill" protests outside the
Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged
that they were spat on and cursed at. Phillips was a featured speaker.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade
legislation, which is aimed at making industries pay for the air pollution that
they create. Speakers for -the group claimed,, with exaggeration, that even
back-yard barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also
involved in the attacks on Obama's "green jobs" czar, Van Jones, and waged a
crusade against international climate talks. Casting his group as a champion of
ordinary workers who would be hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to
Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference
on climate change, declaring, "We're a grasaroots organization. . . . I think
it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy
. families . . want to send
unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent."
Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in
Washington, .including representatives from Americans for Prosperity, told me
that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda
The Republican leadership in Congress, he said, "couldn't have done it without
August, when people went out on the streets. It discouraged deal-makers"—Republicans
who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the
appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K
Street. "K Street is a three-billion-dollar weathervane," Norquist said. "When
Obama was 'strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the Obama
Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what changed it. Now that Obama is weak,
people are getting tough."
As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached, David Koch came to the
Washington area to attend a triumphant Americans for Prosperity gathering.
Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not a single Republican senator was
working with the Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were
writing about Obama's political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups were accusing
the President of initiating "a government takeover." In a speech, Koch said,
"Days like today bring to reality the vision of our board of directors when we
started this organization, five years ago." He went on, "We envisioned a mass
movement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of
American citizens from all walks of life standing up and fighting for the
economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history. .
. . Thankfully, the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to
Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are beginning to see
the same truths as we do."
While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more
recently he has come close to doing so, praising it for demonstrating the
"powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in
government power, the massive efforts to socialize this country." Charles Koch,
in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees, compared the Obama
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs'
sense of imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is
greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and since the seventies
the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than thoseof the middle class.
Yet the brothers' message has evidently resonated with-voters: a recent poll
found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.
Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an
additional forty-five million dollars before the midterm elections, in November.
Although the group is legally prohibited from directly .endorsing candidates, it
nonetheless plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate
races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and running ads
aimed at "educating voters about where candidates stand."
Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum, their larger political battle is
far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed by FrumForum.com this spring, said, "If
you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of
government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country,
doesn't look very good at all." He went on, "It looks like the infrastructure
that was built and nurtured has not carried the. day." He suggested that the
Kochs needed "to get more into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing."
n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash in Los Angeles. He was the
sole passenger in first class to survive. As he was recovering, a routine
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment,
settled down, started a family, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio,
"When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane and everyone
else died—yeah, you think, 'My God, the good Lord soared me for some greater
purpose.' My joke is that I've been busy ever since, doing all the good work I
can think of, so He can have confidence in me."
Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he
became a patron of cancer research, focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to
his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New
York-Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for
cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins University, and twenty-five
millior. to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his
generosity, Sloan-Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership
Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National Cancer Advisory Board,
which guides the National Cancer Institute.
Koch's corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest.
For example, at the same time that David Koch has been casting himself as a
champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to
prevent the E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in
great quantities, as a "known carcinogen" in humans.
Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
major scientific studies have concluded that formaldehyde causes cancer in human
beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on
whose advisory board Koch. sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients
for an average of forty years; subjects exposed to higher amounts of
formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped
lead an expert panel within the National Institutes of Health to conclude that
formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly
controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on
formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch Industries has been a large funder
of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new
regulations until more studies are completed.
Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought
Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-products company, for twenty-one billion
dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and
uses it to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its
annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2 billion pounds. Last
December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental
affairs, sent a formal letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote
that the company ",strongly disagrees" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusion that
formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not
recuse himself from the National Cancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep
formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of
formaldehyde had not come up.)
James Huff, an associate director at the National institute for Environmental
Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., told me that it was "disgusting" for
Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: "It's just not good
for public health. Vested interests should not be on the board." He went on,
"Those boards are very important. They're very influential as to Whether N.C.I.
goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in
formaldehyde."
Harold Varmus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch
from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he used to run. He said that, at
Sloan-Kettering, "a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests.
The one thing we wouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco." When told
of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said that he was "surprised."
he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonian's National Museum of
Natural History, is a multimedia exploration of the theory that mankind evolved
in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confronted with
a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years,
which notes that it is far cooler now than it.was ten thousand years ago.
Overhead, the text reads, "HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD." The
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
message, as amplified by the exhibit's Web site, is that "key human adaptations
evolved in response to environmental instability." Only at the end of the
exhibit, under the headline "OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE," is it noted that levels of
carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are
projected to increase dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for
this development; no mention is made of any possible role played by fossil
fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying
text says, "During the period in which humans evolved, Earth's temperature and
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere fluctuated together." An
interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to
climate change in the future. People may build "underground citieS," developing
"short, compact bodies" or "curved spines," so that "moving around in tight
spaces will be no problem."
Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to
employees, for instance, argues that "fluctuations in the earth's climate
predate humanity," and concludes, "Since we can't control Mother Nature, let's
figure out how to get along with her changes." Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs
the Web site ClimateProgressorg, is infuriated by the Smithsonian's
presentation. "The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue," he said.
"I think the Kochs wanted to be seen as some sort of high-minded company,
associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are
underground funders of action to stop efforts to deal with this threat to
humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line."
Cristian Samper, the museum's director, said that.the exhibit is not about
climate change, and described Koch as "one of the best donors we've had, in my
tenure here, because he's very interested in the content, but completely hands
off." He noted, "I don't know all the details of his involvement in other
issues."
The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about
them. They have been content to operate what David Koch has called "the largest
company that you've never heard of." But with the growing prominence of the Tea
Party, and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement, the
brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently, President Obama took
aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee
fund-raiser, in Austin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent
ruling in the Citizens United case--which struck down laws prohibiting direct
corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to
hide behind "groups with harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity."
. 0bama said, "They don't have to say who, exactly, Americans for Prosperity are.
You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation"—or even, he added, "a

I am hoping you are talking about a Pledge for Palestine, but as I noted a while ago, I had also been thinking about how
he and Gates could globalize their overall Pledge campaign in a way that could help change the attitude/culture of elites
in countries like Pakistan toward greater social responsibility (starting with paying taxes). We haven't gotten that idea
fleshed out yet, but it would be worth at least raising for later follow-up.

A REPORTER AT 1.ARGE
COVERT OPERATIONS
The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.
by Jane Mayetmo,
(.s..
David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred million
dollars to right-wing causes.
On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok the
stage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated for his
generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season,
and had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's co-chairs, Blaine Trump,
in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch had
bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.
The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the city's most prominent
philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre building,
which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is
named for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Koch
pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015

the city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty million
dollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.
One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office
said that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it might
have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth
attacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.
With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate,
headquartered in Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has
grown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in
Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels,
Dixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, and Lycra, among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest
private company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who, years
ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is
exceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services
for the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the
brothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political Economy
Research Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a report
identifying the company as a ""kingpin of climate science denial." The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly
outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change, unclerwriting'a huge
network of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns against
so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that, in political circles,
their ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.
In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report "distorts the environmental record of our companies." And. .
David Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in New York, protested that the "radical press" had turned his family into
"whipping boys," and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for
Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, "The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who has
spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political
manipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've never seen anything like it. They are the
Standard Oil of our times."
few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization that
David Koch started, in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defending
the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures,
lie did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a,dance
performance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit,
warned that Administration officials "have a socialist visiOn for this country."
Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An
advertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. "Today, the voices of average Americans are
being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests," it said. "But you can do something about it." The pitch made no mention
of its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David .
Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said, "What they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought to
you by a bunch of oil billionaires."
In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, saying
that Americans for Prosperity is "an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities."
.Later, she issued a statement: "No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
David Koch specifically to support the tea parties." David Koch told New York, "I've never been to a tea-party event. No one
representing the tea party has ever even approached me."
At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans for
Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: "We love what the Tea
Parties are doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!" she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequent
interview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, "I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!"
She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help "educate" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give
them "next-step training" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled "more effectively." And she noted
that Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs.
"They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board. I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative Of
what they do."
Venable honored several Tea Party "citizen leaders" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its
Blogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama as
the "cokehead in chief." In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of "demonic
possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.)." The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress best
known for her role on the television series "Northern Exposure." She declared, "They don't want our children to know about
their rights. They don't want our children to know about a God!"
During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama
was "the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office," and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—"the government
taking over our economy and our lives." Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was the epic fight of our generation!" As the
crowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: "Victory, or death!"
Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception. In the weeks before the
first Tax Day protests, in April, 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters "Tea Party Talking
Points." The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for
"Taxpayer Tea Party Registration" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. The
North Carolina branch recently launched a "Tea Party Finder" Web site, advertised as "a hub for all the Tea Parties in North
Carolina."
The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to
"educate," fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. Bruce
Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based
think tank that the Kochs fund, said, "The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and no
Indians. There haven't been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been
trying to create a movement." With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, "everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there
are Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power." The Kochs, he said, are "trying to shape and control and
channel the populist uprising into their own policies."-
A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, "The
Koch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and the
frogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!"
The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relations
executive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and Mortimer
Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch,
called him "a patriot who cares deeply about his country." Zuckerman praised David's "gentle decency" and the "range of his
public interests."
The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities, "To call them under the radar is an
understatement. They are underground!" Another former Koch adviser said, "They're smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff
works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves." Rob Stein, a Democratic political

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
strategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are "at the epicenter of the anti-Obama
movement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill •
Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism."
ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch
printer who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemical
engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but, according to family lore,
America's major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home, Koch
found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regime
set up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch was
deeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company,
Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had been
destroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, "As the Soviets became a
stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot."
In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, in
part, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered President
Dwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside, Koch claimed that the Communists have
infiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties." He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression of Communists
in Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. "The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take
over America," he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they would foment "a vicious race
war." In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party's talk of a secret 'socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would
"infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us."
Koch married Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins,
David and William. John Damgard, the president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and friend. He
recalled that Fred Koch was "a real John Wayne type." Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in
Africa, and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound across
from Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed
to join them. "By instilling a work ethie in me at an early age, my father did me a big favor, although it didn't seem like a favor
back then," Charles has written. "By the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time." David Koch
recalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. "He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong
with government," he told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author of "Radicals for
Capitalism," a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. "It's something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big
government was bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good."
David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to military school. Charles, David, and William
all earned engineering degrees at their father's alma mater, M.I.T., and later joined the family company. Charles eventually
assumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and
studied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished him financially.
(Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this:)
In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred
Koch's will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni at
Deerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million dollars, he was made the school's sole "lifetime trustee." He said, "You
might ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let me tell you a story. It all started when
I was alittle boy. One day, my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them for
ten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this went on day after day, week after week, month after month,
year after year, until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!"
David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they did not share all his views, according to
diZerega, who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore in
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Wichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to participate in an informal political-discussion group. "It was
pretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit," diZerega recalled.
DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandOned right-wing views, and became a political-science
professor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles is
one of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward
intellectual trajectory, transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government, and
seeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega
writes, "As state socialism failed ... the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all.
'Socialism' kept. being defined downwards."
Members of the. John Birch Society developed.an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-market
ideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of "The Road to
Serfdom" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek'S belief in
unfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supporters
have championed his work. In June, the talk-radio host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted "The
Road to Serfdom" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the
Kochs; in the midst of arecent on-air parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, "I want to thank Charles Koch for this
information." Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)
Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state
but didn't like the label "anarchist"; he called himself an "autarchist." LeFevre liked to say that "government is a disease
masquerading as its own cure." In 1956, he opened an institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian
Doherty, of Reason, told me that "LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart," and that the school was "a tiny
world of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake." According to diZerega, Charles supported the school
financially, and even gave him money to take classes there.
Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, with assistance from
Freddie, attempted to take over the company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, the
company's board, which answered to Charles, fired William. ("Charles runs it all with an iron hand," Bruce Bartlett, the
economist, told me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983,
Charles and David bought out their brothers' share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained,
and litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990, they walked past
one another with stony expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved to Monaco, which has no income tax.
He bought historic, estates in France. Austria, and elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary
manuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five
million dollars to win the America's Cup, in 1992.
With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the
investment-banking firm Evercore, told me that the company's performance has been "beyond phenomenal." Charles remained
in Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to New
York City, where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A
financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, "Charles is the company. Charles runs it." David, described by
associates as "affable" and "a bit of a lunk," enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South of
France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened
to an "East Coast version of Hugh Hefher's soirees." In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-
thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue, with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan, and
more genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both brothers, couldn't think of a single issue on which
the brothers disagreed.
As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in
America. Charles's goal, as Doherty described it, was to tear the government "out at the root." The brothers' first major public

step came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine, to run for public office. They had become supporters of the
Libertarian Party, and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against Ronald Reagan from the
right. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential
slot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket's
slogan was "The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You." In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch,
who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.
Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that
libertarians were getting ready to stage "a very big tea party," because people were "sick to death" of taxes. The Libertarian
Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wage
laws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs,
and suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a
more traditional conservative, called the movement "Anarcho-Totalitarianism."
That November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand of
politics didn't sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. "It tends to be a nasty,
corrupting business," he told a reporter at the time. "I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas." According to Doherty's
book, the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely "actors playing out a script." A longtime confidant of the Kochs
told Doherty that the brothers wanted to "supply the themes and words for the scripts." In order to alter the direction of
America, they had to "influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks."
fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million
. dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch family
foundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of which
they direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, and
lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress,
has called the Kochs the billionaires behind the hate."
Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008
the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable
Foundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife, along with two company employees and an accountant, spent
more than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.
Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company's
political-action committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns, more than eighty
per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in political
contributions, as it has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family members
have personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David
Koch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a million-dollar donation.
Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically
active nonprofit groups.
In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In
the nineteen-eighties, the Olin family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for funding
right-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of
Andrew Mellon, spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt, a vice-president at the
Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the Kochs' effort is Unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal
funds: "Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering."
Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier George Soros, runs a foundation, the
Open Society Institute, that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generous
private contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including Obama's. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Soros's giving is transparent, and that "none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests." The Kochs
have given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry.
Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a
rationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, "Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom."
Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable
foundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the National
Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the Kochs' foundations as being self-serving,
concluding, "These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact the
profit margin of Koch Industries."
The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations that aim to push the
country in a libertarian. direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice, which files.
lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and
the Bill of Rights Institute, which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by the
Kochs employ specialists who write position Papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has
acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. "If we're going to give a lot of money, we'll make darn sure they •
spend it in a way that goes along with our intent," he told Doherty. "And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we
don't agree with, we withdraw funding."
he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that
Lewis Powell. then a Virginia attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwar
movement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest
crusade against corporations. Powell, writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged American companies to fight
back. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, "respectable elements
of society"—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote, business leaders needed to wage a long-term,
• unified campaign to change public opinion.
Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. "To bring about
social change," he told Doherty, requires "a strategy" that is "vertically and horizontally integrated," spanning "from idea
creation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action." The project,
he admitted, was extremely ambitious. "We have a radical philosophy," he said.
In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute. According to the
'Center for Public Integrity, between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today Cato
has more than a hundred full-time employees, and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the
mainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it has
consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts, reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.
When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming as "beyond dispute," the Cato Institute
took out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts to
stop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed Crane, the Cato Institute's founder and president, told me
that "global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy."
Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climate
scientists at the University of East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared to suggest a
willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went
public, one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries
have since exonerated the researchers, and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus on
global warming. •
Nevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal, more
Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The

Kochs promote this statistic on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fostering
such doubt.
In a 2002 memo, the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as "voters believe there is no consensus
about global warming within the scientific community' the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmental
reform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to
forestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism, such as the Heritage Foundation, which
has argued that "scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming."
The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the Independent Women's Forum, which opposes the
presentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by Nancy
Pfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group's
board.
Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego, is the co-author of
"Merchants of Doubt," a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on
science. She noted that the Kochs, as the heads of "a company with refineries and pipelines," have "a lot at stake." She added,
"If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we shouldn't be
surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail."
David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it has
been, he said, the heating of the planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. "The
Earth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food," he said.
n the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up another
think tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as "the world's premier university source for market-oriented
ideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems." Financial records show that the Koch family
foundations have contributed more than thirty million dollar's to George Mason, much of which has gone to the Mercatus
Center, a nonprofit organization. "It's ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington," Rob Stein, the Democratic strategist,
said. It is an unusual arrangement. "George Mason is a public university, and receives public funds," Stein noted. "Virginia is
hosting an institution that the Kochs practically control."
The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbying
operation in Washington. In addition, he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of the
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation, and a director and co-
founder, with David Koch, of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.
Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed
Crane, the head of the Cato Institute, as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato,
Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's
management philosophy, which he distilled into a book called "The Science of Success," and trademarked under the name
Market-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the
competitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a "holistic system" containing "five dimensions: vision, virtue
and talents, knowledge processes, decision rights and incentives." A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles "thinks he's
a genius. He's the emperor, and he's convinced he's wearing clothes." Fink, by contrast, has been far more embracing of
Charles's ideas. (Fink, like the Kochs, declined to. be interviewed.)
At a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts, Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the Mercatus
Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw
materials into policy "products."
The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center "the most important think tank you've never heard of," and noted
that fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a "hit list" had been suggested first by
Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have "other means of fighting [their] battles," and that the Mercatus
Center does riot actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law professor at the University of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Texas, who specializes in environmental issues, told me that "Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., and
Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency." An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center called
it "a means of laundering economic aims." The lawyer explained the strategy: "You take corporate money and give it to a
neutral-sounding think tank," which "hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.
But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders."
In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oil
refineries. Susan Dudley, an economist who became a top official at the 'Mercatus Center, criticized the proposed rule. The
E.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that
if pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.
In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule, the court
found that the E.P.A. had "explicitly disregarded" the "possible health benefits of ozone." In another part of the opinion, the
court ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional
Accountability Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets, on a Montana
ranch, that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family
foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.
deas don't happen on their own," Matt Kibbe, the president of Freedom Works, a Tea Party advocacy group, told me.
"Throughout history, ideas need patrons." The Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that think
tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street, and to attract the
public's support. in 1984, David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The group,
Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but according to the Center for Public Integrity it was
sponsored principally by the Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission, Kibbe said, "was to take
these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent
revolutions--Saul _Minsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example of
nonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas, not candidates." Within a few years, the
group had mobilized fifty paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charles,
according to one participant, were "very controlling, very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it."
Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated
their business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of "a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil
from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring." The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one
million dollars' worth of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil
measurement is "a very uncertain art."
To defend its reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon
opened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, without
issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal
lives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten,
the counsel to the Senate committee, said, "These people have amassed such unaccountable power!'
.'
By •1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of
corporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on
Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging media events, and targeting opponents.
And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as "designed to strike fear into the hearts of
wavering Democrats." Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita, who supported the B.I.U. tax, recalled,
"I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of
'resources and effort—their employees, too." Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. "I can't prove it, but I think I was probably
their victim," he said.
The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this made
it difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems "myths." When the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had "no citizen membership of its own."
In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called "an audacious plan to pour millions
of dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source," in order to evade
campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in
twenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group,
the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that "the trust was financed in whole or in
part by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas." The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads,
most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active,
the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the
money, refused to comment. In i998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll had
been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as "historic. Triad was the
first time a major corporation used a cutout"—a front operation—"in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of
a company run amok."
uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice
Department filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills,
which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two
hundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to
spend five million dollars on environmental projects.
In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion
that resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final
months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for
covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company
was liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.
The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including
the falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time,
headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as "one of the most significant cases ever
brought under the Clean Air Act." He added, "Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,
and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both."
During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies
of George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed
remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered
enormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, according to a
study by Media Matters, their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since
2000.
In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. The
group's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support for
John Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal, for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political
purposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)
That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink
started a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had
worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-
consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biography
describes him as an expert in "grasstops" and "grassroots" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an even
greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known for praising "throat slitters" in politics, called
Phillips "a grownup who can make things happen."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.
Currently, its Web site claims that the group has "1.2 million activists." Whatever its size, the Kochs' political involvement has
been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity "was micromanaged by the Kochs."
And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the family's other
organizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.
In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of "the greatest loss of
liberty and prosperity since the 1930s." That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives at
a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern,
thanked David Koch, and vowed to "unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!" Sodn after Obama assumed office, Americans
for Prosperity launched "Porkulus" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a
report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, the author was
forced to correct the report, but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing.the paper, had labelled Obama's program "a slush fund," and
Fox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for
Prosperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often
guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)
Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which organized what Phillips has estimated to be
more than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; at
another, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the "Kill the Bill" protests
outside the Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.
Phillips was a featured speaker.
Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, which is aimed at making
industries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed, with exaggeration, that even back-yard
barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's "green jobs" czar, Van
Jones, and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting, his group as a champion of ordinary workers who would
be hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference
on climate change, declaring, "We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy
families . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent."
Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington, including representatives from
Americans for Prosperity, told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. The
Republican leadership in Congress, he said, "couldn't have clone it without August, when people went out on the streets. It
discouraged deal-makers"—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the
appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. "K Street is a three-billion-dollar
weathervane," Norquist said. "When Obama was strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the Obama
Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what
changed it. Now that Obama is weak, people are getting tough."
As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached, David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphant
Americans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working with
the Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups
were accusing the President of initiating "a government takeover." In a speech, Koch said, "Days like today bring to reality the
vision of our board of directors when we started this organization, five years ago." He went on, "We envisioned a mass
movement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life
standing up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfully,
the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are
beginning to see the same truths as we do." .
While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more recently he has come close to doing so,
praising it for demonstrating the "powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in government
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015

power, the massive efforts to socialize this country." Charles Koch, in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees,
compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense of
imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and
since the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message has
evidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.
Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before the
midterm elections, in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates, it nonetheless
plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and
running ads aimed at "educating voters about where candidates stand."
Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum, their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed
by FrumForum.com this spring, said, "If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of
government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country, it doesn't look very good at all." He went on, "It
looks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day." He suggested that the Kochs needed "to get
more into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing."
n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As he
was recovering, a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started a
family, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio, "When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane and
everyone.else died—yeah, you think, 'My God, the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.' My joke is that I've been
busy ever since, doing all the good work 1 can think of, so He can have confidence in me."
Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research,
focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-
Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins
University, and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his generosity, Sloan-
Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National Cancer
Advisory Board, which guides the National.Cancer Institute.
Koch's corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest. For example, at the same time that David
Koch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent the
E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in great quantities, as a "known carcinogen" in humans.
Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several major scientific studies have concluded
that formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on
•whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposed
to higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel within
the National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly
controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch
Industries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new regulations
until more studies are completed.
Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-
products company, for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and uses
it to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2
billion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs, sent a formal
letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company "strongly disagrees" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusion
that formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the National
Cancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep
formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)
James Fluff, an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., told
me that it was "disgusting" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: "It's just not good for public health.

Vested interests should not be on the board." He 'went on, "Those boards are very important. They're very influential as to
whether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde."
Harold Vannus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he
used to run. He said that, at Sloan-Kettering, "a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing we
wouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco." When told of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said that
he was "surprised."
he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, is a multimedia
exploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confronted
with a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years, which notes that it is far cooler now than it
was ten thousand years ago. Overhead, the text reads, "HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD." The
message, as amplified by the exhibit's Web site, is that "key human adaptations evolved in response to
environmental instability." Only at the end of the exhibit, under the headline "OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE," is it noted
that levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increase
dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role
played by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says, "During
the period in which humans evolved, Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
fluctuated together." An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climate
change in the future. People may build "underground cities;" developing "short, compact bodies" or "curved spines,"
so that "moving around in tight spaces will be no problem."
Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to employees, for instance, argueS that
"fluctuations in the earth's climate predate humanity," and concludes, "Since we can't control Mother Nature, let's figure out
how to get along with her changes." Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org, is infuriated by the
Smithsonian's presentation. "The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue," he said. "I think the Kochs wanted to
be seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.
But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to deal
with this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line."
Cristian Samper, the museum's director, said that the exhibit is not about climate change, and described Koch as "one of the
best donors we've had, in my tenure here, because he's very interested in the content, but completely hands off." He noted, "1.
don't know all the details.of his involvement in other issues."
The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate what
David Koch has called "the largest company that you've never heard of." But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party,
and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement, the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently,
President °barna took aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, in
Austin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down laws
prohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind "groups with
harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity." Obama said, "They don't have to say who, exactly, Americans for
Prosperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation"—or even, he added, "a big oil company."

Trip to North Korea, August 24-27, 2010
On July 21 I was informed that North Korea wanted me and my wife
to come to Pyongyang and secure the release of Aijalon Gomes, who had
been arrested in January for entering the country illegally. He had
been tried and sentenced to eight years of hard labor and fined about
US$700,000. Gomes was transferred to a hospital on July 4 and was being
given intensive medical care. They made it clear that I was the only
one whose request for Gomes's release would be honored, and stated that
I would be meeting with Chairman Kim Jong Il and other leaders in hope
of resurrecting the U.S.-DPRK agreements on denuclearization and peace
that were the last official act of President Kim Il Sung when Rosalynn
and I were invited there in June, 1994. Apparently, the N. Koreans at-
tach extraordinary importance to the legacy of their ""Great Leader and
President for all time."
After reconfirming these proposals with the North Koreans, I no-
tified the White House, but the requested mission was not approved un-
til Mid-August, when we were informed by N. Korea that, because of the
delays, Gomes would be transferred from the hospital back to prison. I
was told that Kim Jong Il would no longer be available. At that time
our trip was approved, with the understanding that I would be acting in
a personal and unofficial status, not representing or sponsored by our
government, with minimal publicity for the trip. I accepted all these
restraints with pleasure. In the meantime, an assessment team was sent
from the State Department to ascertain the medical condition of the
prisoner and to seek his freedom. Although I did not receive any brief-
ing on U.S. Korean policy, The Carter Center has monitored developments
in the region as thoroughly as possible, and I was familiar with most
issues.
Rosalynn was unable to make the delayed trip, but I was accompanied by
Dr. John Hardman, CEO of The Carter Center, my son Jeffrey, who has
made a special study of Korean peninsula issues, my assistant Nancy Ko-
nigsmark, and John Moores, who provided the chartered plane that made
the trip possible. On August 21, I notified Gomes's mother that we
would be bringing her son home to Boston, and would call her from An-
chorage, Alaska, to give her a more exact time for our arrival.
With intermediate stops in Alaska and Japan, we then flew direct-
ly to Pyongyang. On the way I prepared a hand-written note expressing
regret that Mr. Gomes had violated the laws of N. Korea and requesting
that he be pardoned for humanitarian reasons.
I was met by Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan, who had partici-
pated in my previous negotiations with Kim Il Sung in 1994 and has been
the chief negotiator for N. Korea in the 6-power talks. He understood
that I had no official status and would never speak on behalf of the
U.S. government. We then went to meet with Kim Yong Nam, who is Presi-
dent of the Supreme People's Assembly Presidium and titular head of
state - whom I also knew from my earlier visit. He was clearly in
charge. After receiving my written request for the pardon of Gomes,
President Kim emphasized the seriousness of three recent American vio-
lations of N. Korean sovereignty (including two women journalists) and
said it would be at least 24 hours before a final decision could be
made. In the meantime, he wanted to explore with me the possibilities
and procedures that might be followed to honor the final commitments of
Kim Il Sung, the subsequent N. Korea-USA framework agreement adopted by
the Clinton administration, and to implement fully the comprehensive
agreements made in 6-power talks in September 2005. (He referred to the
talks as "sentenced to death but not yet executed.")

He and I then spent about four hours in discussion of the key is-
sues, with him giving me a broad outline of N. Korean proposals on how
the existing impasse might be resolved. He requested that I meet with
Kim Kye Kwan the next morning to go into specifics.
After almost 20 hours of travel and the long discussions, we en-
joyed some rest in the lovely guest house, and then continued the next
morning our more detailed talks about denuclearization, U.N. sanctions,
peace agreements, trade and commerce. After lunch I concluded my dis-
cussions, this time with Foreign Minister Pak Ui-chun, and was then
permitted to visit Mr. Gomes. There followed an elaborate ceremony, in-
volving top officials from the army, the National Defense Commission
(chaired by Kim Jong Il), and the Justice Department. Gomes publicly
confessed his crime and read a beautiful letter of apology to the peo-
ple of North Korea and thanked them for his good treatment. After a
brief consultation, the officials gave final approval to his pardon,
but said he would have to stay in the hospital until the next morning,
at which time he would be delivered to us for his journey home.
That night we attended a remarkable concert by the National Sym-
phony Orchestra, which had played host to the New York Symphony Orches-
tra during its visit to Pyongyang in 2008. The orchestra leaders and
all political officials emphasized the importance of a return visit by
their National Symphony to the United States. This seems to be very im-
portant to them.
The next morning Dr. Hardman picked up Aijalon Gomes at the hos-
pital and they met us at the airport for our flight home. At the time
of our departure, a brief press statement was released from The Carter
Center in Atlanta.
From Anchorage, I called Gomes's mother, Mrs. Jackie McCarthy,
and she and Aijalon enjoyed a long conversation before we departed for
Boston. We were met there by about twenty members of the Gomes family,
and there was an emotional reunion. After a photograph of us all to-
gether, we returned home to Plains.

Subject: and so it begins
Post-Daley circus gets started early
Easier to count those who aren't running than those who are
By Rick Pearson, Hal Dardick, Tribune reporters
11:17 PM CDT, September 8,2010
The post-Daley era in Chicago politics began Wednesday with all of the promise of baseball's Opening Day —
no winners, no losers and everyone proclaiming they have a shot at the crown.
With Mayor Richard Daley saying he would not endorse a successor for the Feb. 22 city election, various
political factions engaged in private meetings and a flurry of phone calls aimed at separating the contenders
from the pretenders.
""There will be a lot of candidates," Daley said after his first City Council meeting since announcing he would
not seek a seventh term. "Look at the City Council. All 50 are candidates right now. They all want to be
candidates for mayor and why not? This the best job in America, right here."
In the anteroom behind the City Council chambers, the scene was controlled chaos as more than a dozen
aldermen — white, black and Latino — happily stepped out of the meeting to give interviews to anyone who
wanted to listen about how they could be the city's next mayor.
But the prospective candidates — following the old political adage that it's "better to be looked over than
overlooked" — weren't limited to City Hall.
In Washington, White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was touted by another Chicagoan, President Barack
Obama's political guru David Axelrod, as having the skills and personality to be a big-city mayor.
Amid all the early jockeying, bluffing and bullying, veteran Aid. Richard Mell, 33rd, outlined the nuts and bolts
reality of mounting a mayoral campaign with only weeks before the Nov. 22 deadline for submitting petitions.
"Someone's got to have some serious money. This isn't something you just decide," Mel! said. "It takes a full-
scale ward-by-ward operation to identify your votes and get them out to vote."
Mell also talked about the qualities to look for in a winning candidate — someone who will be a "unifier" and
"can't be looked at as looking at one segment of the city."
Still, many politicians were beginning their assessment by gauging the mood of their political base.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772161 Date: 08/31/2015
"I don't know if it's as important that it's an African-American candidate as it is about a candidate that is going
to be fair to the African-American community," said Aid. Walter Burnett, 27th, head of the council's black
caucus, which met in private at the Hotel Allegro across from City Hall.
"For anyone to run for mayor of the city of Chicago there has to be a groundswell of people in the city to
support them ... Everyone has an opportunity."
At City Hall, amid the swarm of politicians and reporters, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, a South Side Democrat, said
it was "critical" to try to find an African-American contender who would work for the black community's
interests. But the council's black caucus agreed only to try to come up with a list of topics, such as improving
education, that prospective candidates should address.
Latino council members met for lunch and agreed to meet again within the next few weeks, giving potential
candidates time to develop a presentation to make to them.
"If there's a Hispanic that runs, he or she will probably get the majority of the Hispanic vote," said Ald. Danny
Solis, 25th.
"I think more than likely it probably, if you look at the numbers, it won't be a Hispanic in the runoff," Solis said.
"But then I think we can play a very important role" in backing one of the remaining candidates.
But such sentiments didn't deter one of the city's most prominent Latino politicians from declaring that he plans
to run. City Clerk Miguel del Valle told the Tribune he planned to make a formal announcement "down the
road."
Mell and many others expect the field for the February city election will be too fragmented for any candidate to
reach the winning margin of 50 percent plus one vote. If there is no outright winner, the top two vote-getters
proceed to an April 5 runoff election.
One prominent Northwest Side committeeman, who asked not to be identified because of the early stage of the
campaigns, said the measure of those candidates who are real and those who are seeking an ego boost can be
measured in two numbers: 25,000 and $7 million.
Though 12,500 signatures are needed for the February primary, politicians routinely get double the number to
ensure they make the ballot. As for $7 million, the committeeman said, about $4 million would be needed to
ensure a first or second place finish on Feb. 22, followed by a campaign of about $3 million for the April runoff.
"I'm getting a lot of calls about having lunch," said the committeeman. "I've told them to call me back when
they get the signatures and then we can talk about fundraising."
Aid. Patrick Levar, 45th, who is not running for mayor, said this power vacuum reminds him of when Mayor
Harold Washington died and Eugene Sawyer was picked to replace him.
"There's a lot of people who are going to be jockeying for position, but I've learned over the years to sit and
listen and see who can put the different coalitions together," said Levar, who is also the Northwest Side ward's
Democratic committeeman. "Whoever can raise the amount of money and put the coalition together is the
person who is going to win."
While many politicians were starting those discussions, some key Democratic committeemen said they hadn't
heard from Emanuel, one of the most prominent potential candidates.
Emanuel, a former top political aide to Daley and Northwest Side congressman, has previously said he'd like to

be mayor but has avoided the spotlight since Daley's announcement.
Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One that he expected Emanuel
to "take some time to think about what he wants to do with his future."
But Axelrod, who previously served as Daley's political adviser, told ABC News that if Emanuel decided
to leave the White House for a mayoral bid, "the president will support that decision."
Saying mayors are "larger than life personalities," Axelrod said Emanuel "has that combination of skills and
that personality and mindset to be a success if he chooses to go that route."

Subject: Griot education project in Haiti - anothter idea -- much quicker ramp-up
Cheryl:
After watching scenes on TV, talking w/ you and others, here is idea for nearly immediate way to get kids back 'in school'
or into school for the first time. It would be very cheap, could get started very soon—say mid-February, could be linked
to other distribution networks (food/medical supplies), and would be quite organic and grassroots. I'll call it the Griot
education project (in the west African tradition of a streetside storytellers).
Context/Understanding:
Looks like there are a few hundred thousand kids in Port-au-Prince who pretty soon will be (already are) sitting around
day-to-day wi more or less nothing to do. Their schools got destroyed, their neighborhoods in rough shape. These are
young kids who would be best served if they could get out of the house for a few hours a day (possibly even freeing up
parents to do rebuilding or other work), and not spend their time getting caught up in crime, or desperately searching
through rubble for a mal to eat...and get back to school, and engage their naturally curious brains.
The goal of this program is to immediately give them a place to go, a chance to interface with an energetic educator, and
at least expose them to relevant, skill-enhancing academic work that engages them while we rebuild education
infrastructure. It also would likely get them 1 meal each day, and if needed a way to get referred for immediate medical
attention.

Griot Educators:
We recruit and equip a cadre of teachers who will go out into communities with a set of portable materials each
morning—educators who after a few days will find a place to teach, and will have attracted class of students. This is
modeled off the street artist/storyteller.
We flyer the neighborhoods, advertising teaching positions. We work w/ whoever we can find who can help us identify
people who were good teachers prior to the earthquake and/or people who have the abilty to attract kids
(appropriately).
We select teachers. We agree to pay them a daily/weekly stipend. We want people who know their communities, who
don't need a lot of direction, who will take a cart full of educational materials, find a corner, or abandoned building and
start teaching to whoever shows up. People who will do anything to get some young kids to try to read or do some math
problems or sing songs and write poetry...
Education Supply Centers
We set up education supply centers and a distribution system. Each center is staffed by small team-1 lead person is an
education-leader, others are admin and support. Griots come the center in the morning, they get a day's worth of
educational materials (we select it, we photocopy it, we give them 50 pencils, etc.). We agree to send over 50 meals
two hours later. Each Griot wheels his portable classroom to his/her spot and sets up shop...Kids come, and he/she
teaches. It builds momentum and kids get off the streets, out of their homes and come to the morning 'school' site.
Kids who come get a meal. Maybe we end up w/ 3 tiers of Griots-1 who works w/ 4, 5, 6 year olds, 1 with 7, 8, 9 year
olds, 1 with 10, 11, 12 year olds. Each one picks up a packet of material that is more or less appropriate for that age
group. All this is incredibly flexible and fluid. Maybe one morning session and then an after lunch session.
The education supply centers are warehouses we set up. They have copiers, lots of paper, basic school supplies, some
art supplies, etc. (Over time, maybe people donate a bunch of books or magazines, etc—they become ways for artists,
volunteers, entertainers to connect w/ kids, as well.) Each morning a group of Griots go to their supply centers and pick
up materials, and fill up their cart...and roll down the block, or blocks and set up their 'school' for the day. Maybe
someone wants to donate a bunch of art supplies, or harmonicas—who knows—whatever it takes to get kids to show
up and do some academic and enrichment activities. These education supply centers likely get linked to other
distribution hubs. This way they can get linked w/ food or other supplies.
Longer-term/setting the stage for longer-term ramp up
Over time, some of the Griots will end up running little schools that start to feel permanent. Kids will bring in chairs and
stools...maybe some of the teaching material ends up staying at the school sites, and the end up as likely places for folks
to build/rebuild schools. But in the near term, the 'school' is whatever spot the Griot goes to where he/she can attract a
cadre of kids—and the good news is that can be almost anywhere.

This program is cheap -- as costly as it is to pay stipends to the Griots, plus the cost of supplies, delivery, and some
human capital to man the supply centers, develop/acquire high interest, high educational value material. I think quite
cheap, and could easily be costed out once we knew about how much we need to pay a Griot for a day of teaching.
It also gets some folks working, immediately.
Some Griots would take stipend and not teach; some wouldn't do it well; some would pawn off the food/biscuits...But
we could weed much of that out and w/ this sort of approach, you don't let a few bad apples spoil the larger program
(or fear of them stop it from getting started). This program is about planting the seeds for the future schools to come,
about getting young kids off streets and stoops and into a fun/learning environment, about empowering talented
teacher-artists to go out into their communities armed w/ some basic materials, their good will, their creativity (and a
paycheck)—together the kids and the Griots will find local places to call and claim as their schools.
And while this is going on, we have time to build out infrastructure (human capital, facilities, instructional/curricular
materials) for more robust ramp-up over time.
Per usual, feel free to ignore or pass on.

I had a longtime postponed lunch with Betty and David. He was remembering his briefing with you at Blair House before
you were to officially become FL. He said after all the talk about what could be done for kids, he remembers telling you as
he was leaving that you could you make a real contribution on the international stage and he hoped that you would
consider doing so.
He would like to be helpful. He's done a lot of work on preventive diplomacy which he feels is too often overlooked and
extremely essential.

US civilians battle to help Afghanistan
By Matthew Green
Published: March 5 2010 22:43 I Last updated: March 5 2010 22:43
US State Department representative Christopher Harich (top left) and Kevin Melton flank Haji Abdul Jabar as they
discuss the restoration of a religious monument
Each morning this winter, Haji Abdul Jabar has packed a flask of home-brewed green tea for work. It's not frugality; he's
trying to avoid being poisoned. You can't be too careful: before leaving the house, he also straps a Smith & Wesson 9mm
handgun into a holster secreted in the depths of his robes. Seized with occasional fits of passion, Jabar has been known
to whip out the gun during meetings. He may be jumpy, but tactics like this are not entirely out of place in his line of
work: as district governor, the 65-year-old has an unenviable task — of wresting the Arghandab River Valley, one of the
most dangerous places in Afghanistan <http://www.ft.com/world/asiapacific/afghanistan>, from the Taliban.
Viewed from the roof of Jabar's district headquarters, the sweep of the valley is at once beautiful — bleakly majestic -
and charged with menace. A distant range of low, dun-coloured hills defines the valley's opposite flank. Orchards of
pomegranate trees, their branches stripped bare by the cold, line the banks of a river meandering across the valley floor,
dividing the east side of Arghandab from the west.
The district governor's office
The east is where Jabar's office is perched, and where US troops feel safer — it's the west side they call ""bad juju land".
Insurgents use a strip of desert there to infiltrate Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban in the mid-1990s, and the pivot
on which previous Afghan wars have turned. Roadside bombs hidden in the lush vineyards last year turned Arghandab
into a killing field. A battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division deployed here in mid-December is hoping for better luck,
but a new showdown is coming. Stanley McChrystal <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/30b0c4d8-091f-11df-ba88-
00144feabdc0.html> , the Nato commander in Afghanistan, has vowed to secure Kandahar. The Taliban want it back.
One night, one of the insurgents called the governor's mobile. "He said, `I'm going to kill you, you're working for the
Americans," says Jabar, sitting on the carpet in his office. "I said, 'Do whatever you can do.' Then I abused him and hung
up." Jabar normally cuts a rather solemn figure. At this -recollection, he laughed.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774593 Date: 08/31/2015
Jabar is not alone in his mission. Aside from the 2-508 battalion of the 82nd Airborne, two Americans have arrived
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6f824828-183b-11df-9256-00144feab49a.html> in Arghandab to help out: 27-year-old
Kevin Melton and 35-year-old Christopher Harich. They're part of the Obama administration's "civilian surge
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ee3ee108-d60f-11de-b8Of-00144feabdc0.html> ", announced alongside a fresh build-up
of US troops.
Working out of the whitewashed, two-storey district office, this unlikely trio aims to turn the tide of opinion in the
district. They must do it before spring, when the valley will come into leaf and the Taliban fighters return from Pakistan
in time for the fighting season.
"Arghandab is the gate to Kandahar city," Jabar says. "If Arghandab is lost, Kandahar is also lost. It's the most important
valley in Afghanistan."
Haji Abdul Jabar and Kevin Melton of US Aid above the Arghandab Valley
Jabar, Harich and Melton have little in common but their beards. Melton, who grew up in the suburbs of Washington, is
working for USAid, the US government's development agency <http://www.usaid.gov/> . Hard-driving and -anxious to
get results, Melton juggles a raft of plans for projects from solar-powered lamps for villages, to schemes for
hydroelectricity and renovating a shrine clinging to a nearby mountainside. His past experience includes work in Sudan,
but the challenge in Arghandab trumps anything he has previously attempted. "It feels like there's no end to the day,"
he said. "It's physically, mentally, emotionally and intellectually exhausting."
Harich is a lawyer and a former marine from Louisiana who until recently worked as a policy adviser to the governor of
West Virginia. He now represents the US State Department in Arghandab. "I've no doubt in my mind that we're going to
have a fight this summer," he says. "When the Taliban come back in May, are they welcomed with open arms?"
Strapping on their khaki-coloured helmets and flak jackets and donning wraparound protective sunglasses whenever
they leave the base, Melton and Harich bear a distinct resemblance to the US soldiers who protect them.
Jabar, meanwhile, sports neck and wrist pouches containing Koranic charms to ward off the health risks caused by his
high blood pressure. (He takes advantage of the medic in the US military base adjacent to his office for regular check-
ups.)
Both the Americans were lured by the challenge of participating in the US adventure in Afghanistan for a year. Sleeping
in vacant rooms in the district office and equipped with a V-Sat Internet link to keep in touch with superiors in Kandahar
city — but no shower — they must figure out how to work with Jabar to build local government more or less from scratch.
Harich aims to act as a "mentor", helping Jabar as he works with the -provincial government in Kandahar to assemble an
administrative team to govern the district of more than 55,000 people.
There are few tougher places than Arghandab, a valley where a procession of armies have been bloodied. First came the
British in the 19th -century, then the Russians in the 1980s, and then last year, the 1-17 -battalion of the 5th Stryker
Brigade lost 21 soldiers in five months of -fighting — one of the highest casualty rates any US unit has suffered in
Afghanistan since 2001.
Conscious of the rapid approach of the fighting season, Melton is drawing up plans for projects — such as rehabilitating
schools and clinics — that could quickly demonstrate to the locals the benefits of siding with the government of Hamid
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774593 Date: 08/31/2015

Karzai, Afghanistan's president. He works closely with army officers to ensure the military's own plans to implement
projects fit in with the wider, albeit still embryonic, attempts to bolster Jabar.
The trio's schemes can seem like pin-pricks set against the implacable valley below. So far, progress has been largely
confined to Jabar's office. Since arriving late last year, Melton and Harris have renovated the district centre, installing air
conditioners, curtains and carpets.
Jabar, who rarely ventured to his office from his home in Kandahar before these changes, now turns up almost every
day, driving the 30-minute commute in his battered white Toyota Corolla saloon with three police bodyguards,
-constantly wary of the risk of ambush. "Getting the building is easy," says Harich. "Getting a governor to come in and do
some work is a little harder."
A trickle of men with beards and turbans arrive each morning and sit along the wall of the building waiting for Jabar to
arrive, shielding their eyes from the sun as it crests the crags. They come to apply for government identity cards or
attend a weekly council — or shura — to discuss projects planned by Melton. "The fact that they're even discussing this
stuff is mind-boggling," he says. "They're saying, 'I can come to somebody to do something. This is what government is
about: I can air my grievances to somebody other than the Taliban.'"
And yet Jabar is the first to admit that his writ does not run much -further than the building. "I don't trust the people, so
I don't go out much," he says. "They may try to shoot me."
Vehicles out on night patrol
It can be tempting to measure progress in the west's war in Afghanistan in terms of damage to the Taliban — whether in
capturing the movement's leaders or driving back their fighters on the battlefield. Last month, headlines were
dominated by the arrest of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f4f14de4-1b09-11df-88fa-
00144feab49a.html> , the Taliban's second-in-command, and by the big Nato offensive in the town of Marjah
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c8d82998:1411-11df-8847-00144feab49a.html> . But even if more Mullah Baradars are
arrested, more military pushes launched, the Taliban may simply bide their time before once more exploiting alienation
from the corrupt or absent government. The only way to stop that is to undertake the painstaking work of stitching
together a government capable of providing more security and services than the "shadow governments" set up by the
insurgents.
Western countries have been talking for years, of course, about building governance in Afghanistan, but men such as
Melton and Harich represent a renewed commitment. US officials say more than 900 US civilian officers are active in
Afghanistan, compared with just 300 at the start of 2009, with more than 50 destined for Kandahar province. The hope
is that this team can deliver a one-two punch that long seemed elusive by exploiting military victories to nurture
functioning local government. "We have to fix governance in some nominal way or this victory won't stick," says a senior
US official. But the sheer scale of the task in Arghandab alone reveals the enormity of the challenge.
One afternoon, Harich sat with the governor on the office carpet for a lunch of stone-baked bread and spinach. As they
talked, Jabar raised repeated requests: for bars of Dove soap, for boots for his bodyguards. The demands seemed
reasonable enough but Harich did not immediately acquiesce. Part of his job is using the Americans' ability to open and
close the aid taps to get Jabar to live up to their vision of an impartial, honest governor. But Jabar, like Afghan leaders at
all levels of government, relies on a patronage system in which his friends expect to be rewarded and where the barrier
between public and private money is porous.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774593 Date: 08/31/2015
Like much of Afghanistan's political class, Jabar's "legitimacy" comes from his role as a Mujahideen fighter in the 1980s,
battling Soviet -invaders. (Arghandab witnessed heavy fighting: the Russians mounted a month-long siege but never
took the valley.) Although governors in Afghanistan's 34 provinces have the power — in theory — to nominate district
governors, US intelligence officers say Jabar owes his pre-eminence to the backing of Karimullah, the young leader of the
Alakozai, an ethnic Pashtun sub-tribe dominant in the valley.
Said Amir Mohammad Agha, whose refusal to recognise Jabar's authority keeps the valley divided
Divisions between clans mean that Jabar is by no means a consensus candidate. In particular, Said Amir Mohammad
Agha <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/54cf9eca-10e5-11df-9a9e-00144feab49a.html> , the single-most influential man on
the west side of the river, resents him. US officers say Agha was once detained in Guantanamo Bay as a suspected
Taliban commander. As long as Agha refuses to recognise Jabar's authority, the valley will remain divided.
Even on the east side, to the frustration of Melton and Harich, Jabar has yet to prove he can garner much legitimacy.
Locals milling around his office mutter accusations that he skims off salaries for the few district officials who turn up to
work and steers US reconstruction contracts towards his friends. "He's not a good man, he wants money and bribes,"
said one, reflecting comments from several visitors.
Jabar vigorously denies such allegations — indeed, they were linked to one pistol-waving incident in a meeting with the
Americans. Yet such behaviour would not be unusual in Afghanistan, where bribery lubricates the patronage-based
system that Karzai and past leaders have used to hold the ethnically diverse country together. The dilemma runs
through the entire project in Afghanistan. Western officials want to impose a template of efficient administration, but to
do this they have little choice but to work with leaders who rely on the traditional system to survive.
In Kandahar, the dilemma is acute. Afghanistan's centralised system means that Jabar is dependent on the provincial
government based in the city to send officers to fill his largely empty building, but only a few have materialised. Indeed,
Alakozai elders believe rivals from Karzai's Popalzai tribe are exploiting official positions in Kandahar to accumulate
political and economic influence at their expense.
There is a deeper tension. US officials often speak of putting an "Afghan face" on their work. They want to make it seem
as if local leaders are behind improvements to bolster their standing in the eyes of their people. Yet the talk of
appearances is a tacit recognition that the enterprise is, to some extent, founded on creating an illusion of an Afghan
government at work, in the hope that a real administration will rapidly follow. Can such an approach succeed? Assessing
this is hard when even venturing into the valley is a potentially life-threatening undertaking.
The risk of attack in Arghandab is so high that during a recent week in January, Melton and Harich barely ventured from
the base — apart from a brief trip in an armoured convoy to catch up with superiors in Kandahar city. Soldiers of the
82nd Airborne tend to get closer to the locals. Even a short trip out into the east side of the valley shows how close at
hand the Taliban are, and how hard it will be to persuade people that they are safe enough to side with Jabar.
The soldiers leave the base in high-wheeled armoured vehicles called Cougar M-Raps — designed to resist roadside
bombs. Lieutenant Ryan Christmas, a reassuringly experienced veteran of the 82nd, gives a briefing on where the convoy
should go if it gets hit by an IED. "Call out what you see, gunners stay vigilant in what you're doing," he yells at his men,
-clustered around him before departure. "If it looks wrong and smells wrong, it -probably is wrong."

From the bullet-proof window, a procession of mud homes that seem to grow organically from the valley floor rolled
past. A few weeks before, a man had pulled out a pistol and shot and wounded two Afghan policemen near the road.
These days, insurgents are targeting foot patrols to make it more dangerous to try to build up a rapport with locals.
Sgt Donny Kuehner takes tea with Haji Jhapour
At a US outpost at a village called Sakari Bagh, Sergeant Donny -Kuehner, a 23-year-old from southern California, led a
patrol through a bazaar of ramshackle stalls selling blotchy bunches of bananas dangling from strings and stacked cans
of Power Stag — "World's Finest Quality Motor Oil". Removing his helmet, Kuehner entered a petrol station owned by
Haji Jhapour—the unofficial king of the bazaar whose assistant served green tea. An Afghan policeman wearing
mascara and a yellow bandana round his neck joined the circle as the two men talked, via an interpreter.
"How do people in the bazaar feel about us being here?" Kuehner asked.
"The people in the bazaar are good people, they're busy doing business," Jhapour replied.
"You heard anything lately about any kind of Taliban anywhere, or anything?" Kuehner asked.
"I'm so busy with my business, I don't have time to follow the Taliban — this is the job of the police," Jhapour said,
gesturing to the man with the mascara. "When people come here and buy petrol I sometimes hear news. If I hear
anything, I'll let you know."
As he walked back into the base, Kuehner confessed it was hard to know where local loyalties lay. Some of the labourers
busy filling barriers with earth to build up the outpost's defences had been beaten by Taliban fighters. "The locals are
the key to all this," Kuehner said. "Getting them on our side — if we could do that — it would be leaps and bounds from
where we are now."
Such ambiguous encounters are the stuff of the daily grind of counter-insurgency, where building relationships is critical.
After gradually -adopting such an approach to fight the insurgency in Iraq, the US military is honing its skills in
Afghanistan. But it is clear that soldiers can only do so much: unless a viable government emerges, their presence will
have scant lasting impact. As the US faces the risk of increasingly messy conflicts in parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle
East, building governance just after the fighting will be increasingly decisive.
Critics of the approach believe the US is being sucked into an open-ended "nation-building" exercise in Afghanistan.
Barack Obama has been careful to downplay such suggestions <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5f6ce026-df6d-11de-98ca-
00144feab49a.html> , though in Arghandab, the -distinction is blurry.
Locals at work on a US combat outpost
On the mountainside near the governor's office, women climb winding steps to a shrine set high above the valley. They
whisper wishes into stones, wrap them in shimmering cloth and hang them from a pole planted in the tomb of the saint.

The site feels forlorn. Fountains cascading down the rocks have run dry. A restaurant with a panoramic view, film-set
staircases and ornamental trees lies abandoned. Turquoise tiles on the mausoleum dome are cracked.
Clad in their body armour, Melton and Harich take a tour with the -governor one afternoon. Melton wants to see the
restaurant reopen — if a new owner can be found. There is talk of installing a pump to make the fountains flow. In the
valley, a pair of US helicopters pirouette, scanning for insurgents. As the trio ambles about, an explosion sounds far off
on the valley floor. It sends up a puff of grey smoke. Talk of renovation jars with the reality that the fighting season will
soon resume — and the window to get anything done is closing fast.
There is one surprise. One morning, Agha, the retired Taliban commander from the west side, decided to pay a visit. An
enigmatic figure, he clutched prayer beads and produced a certificate from US forces saying he had been imprisoned for
four months in 2004 but no longer posed a threat. He seemed to want Jabar and his crowd to know this. Should he
decide to work with them, US officers hope for an easier year.
Perhaps the influx of troops and resources committed by Washington may encourage men like Agha to reconsider their
loyalties. But after 30 years of war, building institutions will be harder. Both the US civilians and military in Arghandab
were doing their best to help Jabar establish a -government. But all participants seemed conscious that even their best
efforts might not be enough. When Melton and Harich leave, there are no guarantees that Jabar will prosper.
In his waistcoat pocket, the governor keeps a tin of green chewing tobacco, a medallion for "excellence" given to him by
the soldiers of the ill-fated 1-17, and a hand-written letter from Afghanistan's intelligence service warning of a Taliban
death threat. "Every day they are killing someone," he said. Then he climbed once more into his Toyota to brave the
road back to -Kandahar once more, taking his empty tea flask and his gun.

Karl, Frank, Richard,
I hope in the next few days we can focus on some of the themes in the following:
1. On 9 April, I had lunch in Kabul with expert on Afghanistan now based at
was on his way back to Washington via a meeting in Paris with the
French Political Director. He had just spend three weeks in Kandahar and Gardez, his first visit since August last year. He
came across as patriotic, but deeply worried, speaking in a monologue, mostly in French. •

OVERALL SITUATION
2. aid that his assessment was that the overall situation had deteriorated sharply since his last visit. The Taliban B6
were stronger, and more confident, than ever. ISAF was inflicting heavy losses on them, but the scale was as nothing
compared with what the mujahideen had endured at the hands of the Russians. Moreover, the change in rules of
engagement — to prevent civilian casualties, and fewer night raids — had been interpreted by the Taliban as signalling
weakness on NATO's part. In i e w , most of the East, and Kunduz, was effectively lost to the Taliban and their
fellow travellers. US forces in the East controlled the ground they occupied or passed over, but little more: they were in
a similar position to the Soviet Army. Moreover, the population did not want to back them, and was resisting US
attempts to set up tribal militias or implant US Special Forces in the villages. did, however, acknowledge that he
had heard that the US Marines in Helmand were behaving much more sensitively towards the population than had been
expected. But the situation in Marjah was not good. Of course, the Marines held the ground, but violence would
continue for months or years. This did not offer the positive signal of momentum for which the Coalition had been
hoping.
KANDAHAR
3. said repeatedly that he did not understand the strategy in Kandahar. The Taliban had effectively penetrated,
an argely controlled, a city of one million people. The ANP there were largely Barakzai, and working for either or both
of the Taliban or Ahmed Wali Karzai's network. AWK was at the centre of a vast criminal enterprise: his brother-in-law
was one of the largest drug traffickers in the south. When I said that surely ISAF could gradually occupy the city,
squeezing the Taliban back and out,F7said he was not certain of that: he thought that there might well be quite
violent resistance from the Taliban. He was also dismissive of the ISAF strategy of ""managing" AWK: if the latter really
did abandon his criminal ways, he would be dead. He would lose the protection of his militias. In such situations, one
could only move forward, or go into prison or exile: there was no going back. AWK had just too many enemies to survive
in Kandahar without the protection of his own criminal networks.77guess was that AWK would promise to be
good, but in reality stick to his old habits, and hope to profit from the action taken by ISAF against the Taliban.
was dismissive of efforts to empower Governor Weesa, who would not survive five minutes in Kandahar without
Western support and protection. Although Weesa came from the area, he had no power base, and, with his Canadian
nationality, was regarded by the Kandaharis as a foreigner.
4. as also sceptical as to whether ISAF could "shura" its way to success in Kandahar. On the military side, he
thought ISAF just couldn't generate the force densities necessary to control the city: for example, he thought the
Argandab would require getting on for 15,000 troops to control it properly. The city of Kandahar would require some
10,000 fresh police, who were just not available.
NEXT STEPS
5. said he was worried about where the coalition was heading. The best that could be expected was a messy
stalemate in Kandahar, but the probability was, by the early autumn, an outcome that would not look at all like success.

r—,
■vondered whether ISAF really did need to go ahead with its plan to take Kandahar: in iew, he was riding
for a fall. I said that I did not see how we could pull back now. The planners were well aware of the risks, but wanted to
generate positive momentum to enable a political process to take hold.
MAKING PEACE
6.F7said that, in his view, the only way out now was a negotiated peace with the Taliban and all the other parties to
the conflict. He thought that Pakistan would need to help Karzai and the Americans open such a dialogue with the
Taliban, but, sooner or later, both Pakistan and Karzai would need to be moved to one side, and there would need to be
direct talks between the Americans and the Taliban. The Taliban would not make a final peace with Karzai, who had
little credibility left. Similarly, the senior Taliban leaders would need to be brought across the border into Afghanistan,
to get them out from under the control of the ISI. All this would need deception and trickery: for the first time in his
careerould see that diplomats were needed, in this case to finesse a delicate process, involving multiple
negotiations. Karzai would have to eased out, but gently and with plenty of public respect.
7. said that there would need to be a cease-fire, and wondered why ISAF couldn't occupy the high ground by
being the first to offer such a move. There would also have to be frank discussions about the withdrawal of foreign
forces.
8. said that his main worry was that the Obama Administration would waste another year ploughing on with a
military campaign which could deliver stalemate at best, and a serious reverse at worst. Then, with the 2011-12
Presidential election campaign getting going, the White House would panic, handing the problem to Pakistan, and pull
US troops out more quickly than the situation merited. It was vital to get ahead of the curve, and start making
preparations now for a messy political process that could last months or years.
9. said that he had known from 2001 that the Western intervention in Afghanistan had been fraught with danger.
He had suspected then, and knew even more strongly now, that the Taliban could not be defeated or even properly
contained by military means. Once again, he was sick with worry at the way things were going. He had thought that the
Obama Administration had understood that the solutions in Afghanistan were political, not military. He was trying to
think how he and other concerned experts could shock the Administration in getting a political grip on the situation: he
was considering a joint op-ed by a group of experts. The seriousness of the situation meant that such an article would
have to concentrate on essentials: much of the talk about counter-insurgency (in what was an Afghan civil war) and
development and governance was no more than "poetry".
10. I pointed out to the political difficulties for the US and other Western governments in negotiating direct with
the Taliban. Although the principle of a negotiated peace was accepted, more or less, in Washington and London, there
was a long way to go before politicians fully addressed what that might involve. Hence the argument that we needed -
first to get on the front foot militarily. It would help if the Taliban could be pinned down on politically neuralgic issues,
such as women's rights and social restrictions. said that, in a serious negotiation, he thought such undertakings
could be extracted from the Taliban: again, however, the sooner work started on that, the more chance of a satisfactory
result.

11. I told that much of this thinking coincided with the views expressed by the Foreign Secretary in his article in
The New York Review of Books of 29 April 2010 Phad missed the MIT speech, as he had been in Kandahar). The UK B6
election campaign meant that there was little that could be done over the next few weeks, apart from making sure that
incoming or returning Ministers had the best possible advice. After the election, there was clearly a case for a good
strategic discussion between the British Prime Minister and the American President: we all needed to raise our eyes
from the urgent tactical preoccupations in the south to the really important strategic issues, of harvesting political
success from military progress.

Charlie called me last night and he is stoic and brave but I think he would appreciate a call from S - who is simply admires

Dear Trustees and Trustee Associates,
I am writing to share an update on Fr. Beirne's health. Fr. Beirne called this morning to let me know that his cancer has
reached a stage where he has made the decision not to have any further clinical intervention. He prefers to live out the
time he has remaining, six months by the doctors' projections, without the sapping of his energy and other side effects
posed by his recent treatments. I have his permission to share this sad news with you. You may write to Fr. Beirne at
Murray-Weigel Hall where he is now living (see address below) or phone him on his cell phone at
Murray-Weigel Hall
515 E. Fordham Road

I am sure that you join me in offering prayers for Fr. Beirne as he faces the challenges his illness presents in his final
months with us.
