Re: Libya cabinet politics
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya
told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan
Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the

Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction Party (JCP), as well as certain of the other
more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new
government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.
2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party
holding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately
after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to
include in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril's National Forces
Alliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC vote. At that time
Magariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;
however, he did point out that even Jibril's more moderate followers were committed to the idea of a
modern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet. The President came away from this
discussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters intend to marginalize Jibril and
the 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA, concentrating instead on working with
the 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to establish a more conservative administration. This
individual added that Abushagur made it clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice
President and staff, the Prime Minister would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.
3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current crisis in
the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced that the desire
of the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added to the need to
balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the formation of a
cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these developments will eventually
leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)
4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security
situation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the United
States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important role,
rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in Libya
safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to replace the
cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, and the Italian
Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative parties. That said, this
individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the appointment to the ministry of
Mabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who previously worked for Libya's Zueitina Oil

Company as well as in the oil sector abroad. Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the
standing among the foreign oil companies that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable
to a number of the conservative members of the GNC.
5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs and
demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The President
again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the Oil Ministry
post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western governments to gain
acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet Abushagur plans to put
forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other moderate groups, it will still
be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again fail to gain acceptance, leading to
a real government crisis.
6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more than mo
protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs from convening
to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these protesters he did nothing
to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular, the protestors objected to the
failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya region. Although the
demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs, who had said they would
support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their positions. In the end,
according to this individual, Abushagur's efforts to rally their support failed, and he was forced to
withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on October 7, one that would take into
account regional and political considerations.
7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any NFA
ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf is
concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government. In this
regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA holds the
largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the parliament lies
with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on religious and social
matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes that the appointment of
Ali Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would serve to reassure Western
business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance to the Libyan people.
Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication that Abushagur will follow
his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of cabinet ministers associated with
the MB and the JCP.

8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf will remain focused on the
security situation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following the death
of the U.S. Ambassador. According to this individual, Magariaf believes he must end the power of the
regional militia forces before the Libyan economy can improve. The President knows that foreign
companies are the key to Libyan oil production, but he fears that they will not increase their
commitment to Libya until the government can insure the security of their personnel and facilities. In
a final note, this individual added that the Italian government is stepping up its activities in Libya,
and the President expects them to pressure to Al3ushagur appoint an individual like Ben Yezza to the
Oil Ministry, where he can favor ENI and other Italian firms.)

Tom, she moved that yellow chair as close as it went. Knee to knee. Amazed she didn't try knee in between knee. And if
that wasn't enough, she leaned forward. More like a pivot, as far as her torso could fold forward to minimize the space
between their heads. Was like the dental hygienist rolling around the floor to get the best access to your mouth
depending on what tooth she was trying to get access to I've never seen a Westerner invade her space like that And
even the non Westerners I've seen do it based on cultural differences have been only briefly to greet, This went on like
that for 51 minutes - unacceptable in any culture. I don't even think you see that behavior among any type of mammal.
The touching the leg and repeatedly calling her 'Hillary' was just gravy.

QUESTION: So what did you do besides Desmond Tutu? I saw that one — (laughter) — but I know there's been much more.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, we did a lot of internal meetings which are kind of in preparation for everything to come the last

QUESTION: To get done before you actually leave (inaudible)?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Before I actually leave. And also to set up for some post election memos for the President about not
only what we do here at State and —
QUESTION: Are we recording this for sure? You know it's working? Okay.
PARTICIPANT: For sure, yes.
SECRETARY CLINTON: — USA1D, but also for how it interacts with the rest of government, DOD, usTR, Cournant , HI-IS, you
name it. So there's a lot of that work going on. Obviously, we're working hard to be responsive to the Congress in their requests on
our terrible tragedy in Benghazi, and give them information, and try to run an effective, accurate, investigation so we can get to the
bottom of what happened. And then I did have this long, funny meeting with Desmond Tutu and about 10 other people about the
International Day of the Girl, first ever.
QUESTION: I thought that was great.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Isn't that terrific?
QUESTION: As a mother of an only daughter —
SECRETARY CLINTON: Me too, me too.
QUESTION: Like you, exactly.
SECRETARY CLINTON: And I --
QUESTION: And Barbara was one of my daughter and Langley Grace's (ph) teachers.

QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- is Chelsea's, yes, best friend.
QUESTION: Yeah, so I found out about that long ago.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, she's a wonderful teacher.
QUESTION: Yes, she is. She's one of my daughter's favorite.
SECRETARY CLINTON: The whole family is fabulous. In fact, Nicole and Chelsea have remained such good friends, they live in
the same building in New York, and they're just great friends,
QUESTION: Oh gosh, isn't that mat?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah.

QUESTION: Ordered at the highest level of The Wall Street Journal — (laughter) — believe it or not. And I do page one profiles, but
this came down as like, ""You are the star of the Obama Administration."

QUESTION: So I said, "Okay, fine." I had fun covering you in your campaigns.

QUESTION: And so I would love to do it even though I know very little about foreign policy and State — (laughter). I thought,
okay, this will be good for — this will be a good personality profile. Well, it morphed into — now it's become the action profile.

QUESTION: Totally. I mean, you just about killed me over the last (inaudible) — (laughter). I've got nothing. I've got nothing

do is show the countries you visited, we can put that in one color on a map of the globe.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, yeah.
QUESTION: And then if we colored in every country you've talked to or person you've touched, you've been all over the — you've
talked to like almost every country.

SECRETARY CLINTON: I don't think there is such a thing. I think in today's world, there is nothing easy or potentially gliding for
this job. There is just too much going on, and you know everything that's going on because we are hyper-connected. So there's no
doubt in my mind I will work to the last minute before I leave the building.
QUESTION: Has this, though — since I'm focused on this last 4-5 week period — has it been your most challenging part of your
tenure, or not?
SECRETARY CLINTON: It's been among the most challenging. There's no doubt about that. And it's been challenging on many
levels. Of course, the terrible events in Benghazi, but also in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa that didn't get as much
attention because, thankfully, no one was killed or injured. But we've had to keep a close watch on a lot of different places. We've
spent — I've spent time, as you know, in the Far East, in China and Vladivostok, and working on trying to manage what are always
complicated relationships, but made more so because of changes in leadership and challenges like who owns what rock where,
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON; And working hard with the ASEAN nations to support their efforts for peaceful resolution of their
disputes. UNGA is always exhausting. It is a non-stop dawn-to-midnight marathon.
QUESTION: Can I back you up to —

SECRETARY CLINTON: Sure.
QUESTION: Because I've joined you in Jakarta and Beijing.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: That's all I could handle of your trip. (Laughter.) So in Jakarta, I watched you talk to the embassy folks there and
noticed one person said to you, "I can't wait to vote for you in four years."
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh,
QUESTION: You said, "Bless your heart," or something like that. (Laughter.) Okay, so — but I want to lay to get — I want to put —
string together these anecdotes.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Okay.
QUESTION: So I want to get your perspective on some of the things I saw. Now, in Beijing, a similar thing came up. I heard, at the
dinner — that dinner 'tit I a.m. So — did the Foreign Minister say to you — somebody told me he said to you, "You will be so young
when you are President." Do you remember his saying that?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, it wasn't the Foreign Minister.
QUESTION: Oh, who said it?
SECRETARY CLINTON: It was the State Counselor --
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- Dai Bingguo, who has become a very good partner for me as I've worked with China. He was my
counterpart in the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, and he was kidding me because he's retiring.
QUESTION: Are you sure he was kidding you?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I think so. That's my interpretation. He's retiring and he's probably at least ten years older than I
am. And he's saying to me, "Why are you retiring? You're so young!" [said, "Boy, I'd travel a thousand miles to anywhere to be
told I was so young." (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON!: But it was more along the lines of, he will be leaving with the change in leadership in China, and I will
be voluntarily leaving, as I announced a year ago.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah, more on that later.
Okay, so then, the next day, you have Xi cancel on you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. I'm not --
QUESTION: Now, he cancelled on others, too.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: But you were told — were you told it was the back injury?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. But that — we were told the night before, and I took it at face value, really, because from our
perspective, I had a very good set of discussions with him both here in Washington and in my previous trip to Beijing. And as you
know, he was unable to keep his schedule for ten days.
QUESTION: Right, he'd not been seen in public, exactly.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, so I didn't really think anything other than what I was told.

QUESTION: Did it frustrate you, though? 'Cause you were all the way over there, and --
SECRETARY CLINTON: No, because I had so many other meetings.
QUESTION: Okay. Okay, okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I mean, I didn't go specifically to see him. I went to continue our dialogue.
QUESTION: Did they get a little ticked off that we reported that it was a back injury, since they like to keep things so close to the
vest?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I don't — I don't know that.
QUESTION: Okay. And then at your press conference, I sat in the front row right in front of you because I was a pool reporter.
PARTICIPANT: Just like this. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Yes, you know me. I like to be very touchy-feely. If I could've touched you, I would.
Anyway, so I sat there, and you as a politician came through to me loud and clear. You took control of that press conference, okay. I
mean, you said your little pleasantries, he said his pleasantries, and then you took charge. And it wasn't just about the South China
Seas. You hit all the things, Syria, Iran, not — and all the others. North Korea.
So then he was on his heels. And he's like — he was wanting to get in. So tell me: What was your thinking? Was it purposeful? Was
that your strategy going in? I'd like to — I want to describe that, because to me, you clearly had the political savvy over your
counterpart.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, we have very different systems. He's an incredibly accomplished diplomat, and as you rightly
point out, we both made our points. And I --
QUESTION: He did make his points, but only after he was on his heels.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, that's your interpretation.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I had a very clear understanding of what I needed to say because there were all these issues that we were
talking about. And they are complicated, challenging issues. So I wanted to be sure that I put it out there, and I didn't want to say
anything other than what my assessment was at the time. Some people say, "Well, you're in a foreign country, you shouldn't do this,"
or whatever.
QUESTION: Yeah, exactly.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Now, I mean, I think we're living in a world where everybody knows what you say everywhere.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: And I believe you have to say the same thing, you have to be consistent, repetitive, make the case
knowing full well that there's a resistance on the part of China and Russia to be more constructive in the Security Council. But insofar
as I could break through in their mass media as well as the international mass media, I was going to make that effort.
QUESTION: Which goes to this point which I was going to get to a little bit later about — one way you've tried to change, I think,
the Secretary of State — you've changed the terms of what it means, is this public diplomacy. You are knowing you're reaching a
different audience. You're not just playing right there at that press conference.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right. A hundred percent right, Monica. I mean, I believe I am the chief public diplomat of the State
Department, and as well as the chief diplomat. But there's the public role to it, which is increasingly important, because you can't just
go somewhere, have your meeting behind closed doors, do a controlled readout, and go on to the next capital. Because in every
society now, you have to recognize there is a public audience as well as an official audience.

So I am conscious of that from the very first trip I made in early February 2009. I've been trying to talk about America's values and
our interests and our security everywhere I can.
QUESTION: Is that in pant — did you have a vision that you also have to remake America's brand?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I think we — I think our brand was battered for a lot of reasons. We came into office in the midst of the
economic crisis, which was very dangerous, and I thought that — and still do that confidence is a commodity, and we had to show
confidence. We had to be making smart decisions. We had to reassure leaders and markets and people, and that was part of my job
on that first trip that / made and every trip since.
I was in Hong Kong when the debate over the debt was going on, and I had all of these very wealthy, distinguished, high-ranking
people from Hong Kong lining up to say, "What's going to happen in America? What are they doing over there?" And I said, "Oh,
don't worry about it. We will get to a decision." Because! had to be, at that moment, displaying the kind of confidence that our
country has, and our ability to make decisions, even hard decisions, in order to keep leading the world economically and politically,
and I believe that,
QUESTION: Okay. Let me then jump — you came — well, of course, there's the campaign. On September 6th, you watch your
husband at the convention.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: Okay. What did you feel at that moment?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, I was thrilled. It was so odd for me not to be there. I've been at every convention for decades, and
there I was in East —
QUESTION: Did you miss it?
SECRETARY CLINTON: — in Timor-Lege.
QUESTION: Yeah. Yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I missed a lot of what goes with conventions seeing people from all over the country, having that sense
of purpose that a convention is supposed to give you to go out in the election and work your heart out for your candidate. But on the
other hand, I also believed and knew that what I was doing was very important for my country, So I certainly didn't miss
QUESTION: And did you hear you were a big topic of conversation there about whether Hillary —
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, well —
QUESTION: --2016?
SECRETARY CLINTON: That seems to be a topic of conversation for a lot of people, which is —
QUESTION: Everywhere, okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- which is fine.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: But it was thanks to the hard work of Philippe and others that we were able to see in nearly real time. I
mean, we had to wait till it was recorded, because I had a schedule that I had to keep, but then we were able to watch the whole
speech. It was great.
QUESTION: Yeah, Okay. Now, you came back home September 1 Ph. So let's talk about how you faced that day, just a couple key
moments, because I don't want to relive the whole thing.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: But what were the key moments to you? Was it when you first were told the Ambassador's missing? Was it when you
found out he was actually — they had found him?

SECRETARY CLINTON: No. It predated that, because I take September 116' very seriously. I was a senator from New York on
September I 1th.
QUESTION: Right. And I lived in New York on September 1 Ph at the time.
SECRETARY CLINTON: And it was a searing, painful experience in every way, and so every September I I'm on hyper alert
for what's going on around the world. And we always have discussions in our security — among our security experts okay,
September I le is coming up. Because we pick up intelligence, we pick up chatter that people might want to do something somewhere
in the world. So everybody is watching. That's but we had a very strong set of standards that we've tried to follow around the
world.
And then simultaneously, we had this video coming out, which we were getting lots of feedback from our posts that this was a
problem, that people were reacting to it So there was a lot swirling around. And clearly, when we started hearing about what was
happening in Cairn, what was happening in Tunisia, what as happening in Benghazi and other places — because there were
demonstrations going on in many places and they were being to some extent, hijacked by extremists with other agendas.
But then when we were alerted to what was going on in Benghazi, we were all just totally focused on trying to find out what we could
under quite difficult circumstances, and we're still trying to get to the bottom of what happened when. But that day, it was all
consuming. We were all just as active as we could given the distance, trying to manage everything that was happening, and be
responsive in real time. And of course, it was primarily the duty of the security experts who have those responsibilities, but I was here
and others were here trying to sort through all the information as it was coming in.
QUESTION: Do you — today the front page of the Post says this is now going to mar your — what had been your great record at
State. I mean, are you ultimately, Hillary, going to have to take responsibility for this'?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, I take responsibility. That's not even — that's not a question. I take responsibility. I'm the
Secretary of State. I have 60,000-plus employees around the world, and this is like a big family. I mean, these Foreign Service and
Civil Service officers, many of whom have worked with each other, they know each other, I have — I'm working with people today
that I first met when I was First Lady, and they were a young diplomat somewhere that I showed up. I sent Chris Stevens to Benghazi
in the height of the Libyan conflict.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: And he was eager to go, and he was very effective, and then I recommended him to be our ambassador,
and I had the highest regard for him.
QUESTION: Gosh, that must make it that much —
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, it's painful, Monica. It's absolutely painful, because it's not °tat a faceless person.
QUESTION: Yeah, exactly.
SECRETARY CLINTON: It's people who, if I didn't know them personally, somebody close to me in this building knew them, had
worked with them, was at the same post five or ten years ago. So there's an extraordinary sense of loss and responsibility. Every one
of us who had any responsibility, from the security experts on up, we all feel like we have to figure out what happened, because we
clearly want to make sure it doesn't happen again. But there is an inherent risk in this job.
When I okayed sending Robert Ford to Hama at the beginning of the Syrian conflict, that was a risk. We said. "Robert, do you want
to go there'? It's dangerous. We can't guarantee your safety, because we have to rely on host nations."
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: But you think it's the right thing to do. It clearly sends a message about where the United States' values
are.
Or when I was in Egypt, and we were protested against in Cairo, and then the security people came to me and said, "You're supposed
to go to Alexandria. It's a much less fortified position than we have in Cairo. Maybe you shouldn't go." I said, 'No.'" I said "I'm
going to go." I went. But I mean, we had people throwing shoes and tomatoes,
This is an inherently risky world. It is a dangerous world. And we will do our very best, as our military and intelligence colleagues
do, to try to think through how to provide as much security as possible, but you can't keep people behind 20-foot walls and expect

them to do their jobs. And whether it's the Marine barracks in Beirut being blown up or a CIA outpost in Afghanistan, Americans
need to realize that it's not only our soldiers; it's our civilians serving our country who are also putting their lives on the line to —
QUESTION: Well, that's been the wakeup call of this incident.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- to do the job that we ask them to do.
QUESTION: So one thing that a lot of people have said in this is another — somebody from the White House told me they thought
watching you and °barna at the Andrews Air Force Base, there was a new bond between you two, that everybody knows you all
aren't buddy-buddy, but you all clearly respect each other and work together. Do you feel that you had a new bond? I mean, I saw
that you touched his hand on watching the— watching it, you touched his hand after he spoke, and then when you all walked back to
the families that he put his arm around your waist. Do you feel this gave some — did you feel that at that moment? Somebody at the
White House saw it, and then somebody at the State Department also thought so.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I feel like there have been a number of moments — maybe not public moments —that have been
very, very precious to me in my relationship with the President I was in that very small group that made the decision about bin Ladin
and was there in that Sit Room, and --
QUESTION: Right, which we've all seen that picture.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, going up and down the emotional rollercoaster. And walked with him across the Colonnade in the
White House for him to address the nation. I mean, there are a lot of moments, but that was a particularly poignant time for both of us
because we live every day — he as President, I as Secretary — with the knowledge that decisions we make, sending a Chris Stevens to
Libya, are ones that have risk and danger attached to them. And so I —
QUESTION: When he came here that —
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes.
QUESTION: next day, did you call him and say, "I'd love you to come over?"
SECRETARY CLINTON: I did. I did.
QUESTION: Do you call him, like, on the secure phone?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, yes.
QUESTION: Where's the secure phone?
SECRETARY CLINTON: In my office.
QUESTION: Oh.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, yeah, we have a secure phone. Yeah.
QUESTION: I know. Did you call him on the secure phone?
SECRETARY CLINTON: We wanted --
QUESTION: Or do you only do that if there's, like, a real emergency?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. We communicate in lots of different ways. But I thought it was important if he could, but it was
— I knew that he has a lot of other demands on his thne, and I was going over to the Rose Garden and then I said, "Mr. President, can —
do you have time to come by and see our people if we can get them gathered?" And he didn't hesitate, absolutely. And it was --
QUESTION: Do you say Mr. President or do you say Barad?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I do. I say Mr. President. I believe strongly in saying Mr. President.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I think it's a sign of respect for the person and for the office.

QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I mean, I called him Barack when I was a senator with him, but --
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- now he's the President and [respect that.
QUESTION: Okay. Now let's start going toward UNGA. The — on September 15', I think the Saturday before Netanyahu was
going to be on Meet The Press, you had a private call with him.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I did, I did.
QUESTION: Okay. And that — the Mideast thing and Iran, it's kind of been in tumult. So the relationship — do you feel that you
need to work your — work on that with your past relationship with him? I mean, this is — as two politicians to one another, what's —
show me how this works.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, look. I've known Bibi a long time, and I consider him a friend. He is somebody who I've spent a
lot of time talking to in New York, in Washington, in Jerusalem. We have had long in-person conversations, long telephone
conversations. And I respect the fact that he is trying to protect Israel, that — I often tell people, put yourself into the position of the
Prime Minister of Israel at a time of great tumult and uncertainty. And so I guess I would say, on a pretty regular basis, we — I check
in with him.
QUESTION: Does that help, though, given that, kind of, people view his relationship with the President as rocky, that you all --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well --
QUESTION: -- are in kind of— have your own relationship?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, here's — I think he's been around so long he has good relationships with a lot of people, and I think
he has a relationship of mutual respect with the President. And his concerns about what's going to happen are totally
legitimate. They're concerns that the President shares, which is why the President has said our policy is prevention, not
containment. And he's been very, very clear about that.
QUESTION: Okay. Now then you go to New York for UNGA. But I talked to Betsy, your friend from Park Ridge.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.
QUESTION: Okay. So she brought this up on her own about your hair.
SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.)
QUESTION: She said --
STAFF: I'm amazed you got — what --
QUESTION: (Laughter.) The pizza party --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, right.
QUESTION: At the pizza party --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.
QUESTION: -- she said to you she likes your hair long, and she said it suits where you are in your life right now. Do you remember
her saying this to you?

QUESTION: know. This is great.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I would be happy to talk to you sometime about all of— all that, all that stuff.

SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.)
QUESTION: So anyway, so you have the pizza party, then — and your husband and your daughter are there.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: At least that was a nice break.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.
QUESTION: Okay. Then you go into full-scale work.
SECRETARY CLINTON: UNGA, UNGA, UNGA.
QUESTION: Okay. But you first appeared at the Clinton Global Initiative, which was a key —
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, no. I started working on Sunday.
QUESTION: Oh, okay, okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I was at the Clinton Global initiative Monday morning, but I started having what we call bilats on
Sunday.
QUESTION: Okay. Yeah. And I wrote down you did — it looks like you had 29 bilats, you had 54 meetings or events that
week. And I don't know if you noticed, but I was running in as a little pool reporter just to see any glimpse of you
SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.)
QUESTION: And I would try to hang to hear what they were saying The Yemen President said you work nonstop, you're shuttling
around the world, you're on TV every day.
SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.) Yeah.
QUESTION: I mean, your public image is really fascinating --
SECRETARY CLINTON: For people all over the world.
QUESTION: to all these foreign leaders.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, I know.
QUESTION: I mean, they really, like, admire that.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well --
QUESTION: Don't you think — what does that tell you?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, look. I think in today's world, America has to show up. We have to show up in a lot of places to
make the case for what we believe are the right choices for us and for partners and the world. So I'm constantly being told by leaders,
presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers, "I'm exhausted watching you."

QUESTION: Exactly. I once heard — they'll say that.
SECRETARY CLINTON: They're the very same people who get quite unhappy if! don't show up.
QUESTION: Exactly.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Like, Oh, can you come to this?" "Gee, I'm so sorry I can't." "Okay, I'll change the date. When can
you come?' So — and I know that it might not have been quite as important in times past, but now, because you're covered on
broadcast television, you're covered on the interne, people know you're there and you're making a case. And you're respecting
another country and another country's leaders enough to be in their palace, in their office, in their parliament.
And I have found that it eases the way for building interpersonal relations, which at the end of the day are at the root of much of what
we do in foreign relations. Doesn't mean that people are going to give up their self-interest or change their human nature. That's not
going to happen. But that there may be an opening that you can take advantage of to make a case that might otherwise not have been
heard if you were just barking orders at them from a thousand miles away.
QUESTION: Yeah. I know. You know what? I'm all about relationships, not transactions, and I see that in you --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah.
QUESTION: -- in how you do your job.
SECRETARY CLINTON; It really matters. It matters. It's always mattered.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: But it especially matters in the world today.
QUESTION: I see that loud and clear. Okay. And then in the week of October, I noticed on your schedule — well, is there anything
about the UN, was there any key — you also met with people that are higher than you --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, right.
QUESTION: -- because Marna left all that to you. Was there any key meeting that! should focus on?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I mean, gosh, there were so many. I mean --
QUESTION: I mean, the bulk of it was unbelievable, but was there one moment that was the one I should pick out --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, I don't --
QUESTION: -- that was particularly sensitive or --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Let me think about that, Monica.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Because, I mean, we had very intense conversations with the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan and
Egypt and --
QUESTION: Yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- Yemen and Libya and — (laughter) —
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I mean, it was a --
QUESTION: Well, maybe you could tell Philippe --

QUESTION: -- what would be the best one to single out from that time period.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Okay. We'll go through — yeah.
QUESTION: I mean, the bulk of it and then --
STAFF: Well rank all 24.
QUESTION: (Laughter.) And then on October I', that week, you led the U.S.-Afghanistan Bilateral Commission.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.
QUESTION: Is that important?
SECRETARY CLINTON: It's very important.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: It's part of— we negotiated something called a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Afghanistan as a
way of both committing ourselves to an enduring partnership with the Afghans, having an agenda that we would both follow so that
there wouldn't be second-guessing and finger pointing We would say, "Look, here's what we want to work on together, and here's
how we have to proceed." And this was the first of those meetings. And I found it to be much desired on the Afghan side, and on
ours as well because we wanted to clarify what we were going to be focusing on together.
QUESTION: Even after the — what's been happening with the suicide --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, right.
QUESTION: -- acts and all that? Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right, right.
QUESTION: Okay. Okay. Now, what do you want to be your legacy?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, gosh. I have not stopped to think about that.
QUESTION:, Really?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Again, I will stop to think about it maybe in three months.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I'm so in the moment. People say to me, "What are you going to do next? Looking back, what's your
legacy?"
QUESTION: Yeah, that's coming to — yeah, yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Honestly, I can't answer those questions because I just haven't allowed myself to stop and think them
through. And I don't want to divert my mind from what's going on right now There's too much going on right now that I have to be
focused on, so I'll let the rest work itself out.
QUESTION: Do you think, given the way the world is right now and how tough this last few weeks has been, have you even given a
thought to maybe staying as Secretary of State?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, a lot of people have talked to me about that, but I --
QUESTION: But has the President?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I'm not going to go into any conversations with anybody, but I would be unlikely to do that. I
really made up my mind — now, at least a year or so ago — and I want to follow through on that. Because I think it's important for me

to just step off the incredibly high wire that I've been on for the last four years — actually for the last 20 years —just to take stock of the
rest of my life which is before me.
QUESTION: Yeah. And do you — I know you haven't given a lot of thought, but is there something that you just can't wait to do?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, yeah, sleep. Sleep would be good.
QUESTION: How do you balance all this? I mean, you do go nonstop.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, I do.
QUESTION: I mean, I've gained five pounds just travelling with you. (Laughter.) No joke. On that travel, it was an excuse to eat
shit. (Laughter.)
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, there's a lot of it around. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Yeah. I mean, you just grab food. They're like, oh, well I need this to get through the day. And I wasn't even
performing like you are; I just sit here and do nothing. So I blame you for this. So how do you do it?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I take responsibility for that too. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, exactly. (Laughter.) How do you, like, balance --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first --
QUESTION: -- this physically and also to be, like, a strong leader but also then have the compassion and the person? I mean, how
do you pull it off?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. Well, I mean, first, it's just who I am. And I don't think about it being anything other than going
about my business. But look, I do try to exercise, I do try to eat right. I fall off the wagon on both. I do try to get enough sleep.
QUESTION: Yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Not easy to do. Try to catch up it with whenever I can. But the work is so consuming, intellectually
demanding, with such high stakes — literally life and death at stake —
QUESTION: Yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- that I am constantly thinking and planning and reacting, trying to manage this extraordinary panoply
of issues around the world that I think are going to affect my country, my daughter, the future that I would like to see, and so it gets
me up every day and keeps me going till late at night.
QUESTION: And do you — your colleagues here tell me — you've got a great team, by the way — I have so much fun with them --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you.
QUESTION: -- and they're all very talented.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you.
QUESTION: But do you — they all tell me how you're always searching for the next best organizer.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes.
QUESTION: Saying you're always looking for the next best binder or — so what is this about you that you --
SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.) It's almost a game that I play with myself. When you have as much coming at you as I do
every day, it's kind of a constant joke we have. Okay, our cards or paper or our boxes or some other form of storage — I mean, it's just
a way of kind of keeping it light, because there's so much serious that we have to do all the time.
QUESTION: And do you — is it true that the President gave you, like, an inscribed iPad cover or something?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, he gave me a great iPad cover that has my initials on it, which was really very welcome because
it's hard, so when you travel as much, it doesn't get knocked around.
QUESTION: Was it for a particular occasion? Or did you see one that he had or what?
SECRETARY CLINTON: We were just talking one day. We do that. I mean, I gave -
QUESTION: I know you're going to see him after me.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Very - yeah, very shortly, yeah.
QUESTION; I'll be happy to go with you, (Laughter)
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, I know I gave him an espresso machine one time We were talking about good espresso and how
hard it was to find. And I really enjoy mytime with him, and I also know probably better than anybody because of what - the
positions that I've had, and the respect I have for how hard - how impossible the job has always been, but certainly is today. It's not
all bad news. I mean, there's a lot of bad news I have to deliver, a lot of difficult issues I have to raise, a lot of hard questions be has
to grapple with So it's nice every so often to - like when Be the dog came in to see Aung San Sua Kyi, when I went to see -
QUESTION: Oh, well, I wanted to ask about that --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, when I went to see her in Burma, I brought her gifts, which you do when you travel through
protocol. But I brought a gift for her dog she adores her dog - and the dog was such good company when she was under house
west. And so when she went to the White House to see the President, she really wanted to meet Bo the dog who she had heard about,
and the President was so great.
QUESTION: Oh, that's cool.
SECRETARY CLINTON; He had Be outside the Oval Office and when the meeting ended he said, "Oh, wait, one more person I
want you to meet"' right? And in came Bothe dog She was so thrilled. I mean, we try to make it not just a grind because it could be
with everything going on in the world, literally just debilitating- trying to figure out the right thing to do how best to protect
America, how to get our values across, how to deal with intractable situations like the ones we face in so many places, So every so
often, we kind of lighten it up.
QUESTION: Which I forgot to mention in my little timetable of the action profile about you - you did see her when she was here
and you said you know something about being kind of an icon and becoming a politician, what that entails.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
QUESTION: And you had her to your home for a dinner.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I did. I did.
QUESTION: And can you tell me a little about that and what that meant to you?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I -
QUESTION: Had she been to your home before?
SECRETARY CLINTON; No, no.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON; She hadn't been in the United States in, I think, 40 years.
QUESTION: Oh, wow.
SECRETARY CLINTON: We can check that, but I think it's like 40 years. She had me in her home, and it was such an emotional
experience, and obviously I wanted to reciprocate. And so I had her in my home and we had a very small dinner. And before the
dinner, I spent about an hour with her just talking like two old friends, because I had felt when I met her for the first time that we'd
been friends forever. And I just so highly admire her but I also have such affection for her

QUESTION: Now you did talk about what it's like to be a politician and things like that --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right, right
QUESTION: -- and get into the nitty-gritty. Now your approval rating right now is close to 70 percent. So a lot of people are asking
the obvious question: What about 2016? And people — do you think now people --
STAFF: I thought the obvious question was: Who are the other 30? (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Well, yeah. What happened with the other 30? How are they not approving? (Laughter.) So do you — I mean, do you
think that — why do you think people see you now differently than when you were running for office, or --
SECRETARY CLINTON: I can't even speculate on that, Monica, because I feel like I've always been the same, other than perhaps
my hairstyles, which have changed over the last 65 years.
QUESTION: (Laughter.) Haven't we all, though? Yeah, even men's.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, indeed.
QUESTION: It's not just women.
SECRETARY CLINTON: But I feel like I've been the same person but in different roles over time. And I appreciate the fact that
people are favorably inclined and supporting what I'm trying to do as Secretary, but I can't really venture a theory as to why or why
not. I just have to get up every day and do the best I can.
QUESTION: Do you think there's a difference, Hillary, in seeing you running and campaigning versus governing? Or --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Could be. Could be.
QUESTION: But you — do you have a -- do you give it any thought?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I really don't. I really don't.
QUESTION: Okay. Well, you're too busy to even think about it. So there we have — a lot of people think you've got to run in 2016
and that service is so important to you that, ultimately, if it's there, they can't imagine you would say no. Now of course, it's not as
easy as everybody thinks it's going to be. (Laughter.) They think it's going to be there for the taking for you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right. Well, but I have always believed in service, but I did not for — what, 53 years of my life —
ever believe I would run for office. I respected people who did like my husband and supported a lot of candidates over the course of
my adulthood and — actually even before — I was a Goldwater girl when I was — I don't know — whatever glade I was.
So I don't know why it would be surprising that I said, look, I intend to do service, but I intend to do service in a different capacity —
going back to the advocacy community, working on women and girls, working in the Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative --
QUESTION: So you wouldn't start your own foundation since you've got that big apparatus there that's so successful.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, yeah. I mean, I think — I mean, and it seems to me that there's just a great opportunity to expand
what we're doing, to deepen it in areas that I'm interested in. But again, I haven't made any decisions. I just know that I will always
want to be of service. I believe in service. And one of my mentors, Marian Wright Edelman, and — used to quote all the time that
service is the rent we pay for living on this earth, and I think that's exactly right.
QUESTION: But you're not ruling it out?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I have ruled it out. I have ruled it out. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Oh, my God. I don't want you to say that. I think it would be more fun if you said — (laughter) — I've not ruled it
out. (Laughter.)
SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.
QUESTION: Seriously. Okay. So is there anything else that — in this action profile about you that you think I've got to include that
I'm missing.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, my gosh. I don't know.
QUESTION: Of course, I wanted to talk to the President and Chelsea, but Philippe said no.
STAFF: I did.
QUESTION: And he did. (Laughter.)
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. He's a hard taskmaster.
QUESTION: Isn't he?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I don't know. I'll think about it. I mean, I that period was so —
QUESTION: It was so jam-packed.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- jam-packed.
STAFF: (Inaudible) you have to be more specific. What did you actually want?
QUESTION: What do you mean?
STAFF: Tell her what you actually asked for.
QUESTION: Oh. Oh, I wanted — you mean, like, just hang out? Like, go on a --
STAFF: No. You wanted —
QUESTION: Oh, I wanted to have dinner in New York with you and the President and Chelsea.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: That's what I asked for. Or breakfast.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I want to do that. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Or coffee. (Laughter.) That's what I asked for And then I said [just want to hang out with Hillary and just know
what it's like to be Hillary. I asked for all kinds of things, and he thought I was like a nutcase.
STAFF: She wanted to take a walk with you.
QUESTION: Oh, yeah. I said I could go for a walk. Oh, God. I did once. When I did the profile of Michele Bachmann, I went for
a walk with her. Oh, my God, she like freaking wanted to kill me. Do you know what I mean'? She does this fast walk. And so I was
carrying my little recorder, and then all I could hear when I played it back was like me like that. (Laughter.) You know what I
mean? She was, like, going to run me into the damn ground.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, my gosh. You did a profile on her?
QUESTION: Back when she — the two week period she was surging in Iowa at the start of the Republican's — and then she was gone
as all the Republicans popped up and then were gone.
SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.
QUESTION: Do you know what I mean? But anyway — (laughter) — all right, now, let's see. And then the other thing I was going
to get into was just the — how you have to be a leader and the muscular part of you versus the compassionate, the pragmatic part of
you, but the lofty goals part of you
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: So is there anything in this last few five weeks that you think kind of puts you there?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, yeah. I mean, I think - look, I mean, what happened in Benghazi, but also elsewhere in the
Middle East. I mean, I had to get on the phone and really strongly demand that governments do more to take care of our people. I had
to be present for the State Department family when we lost four colleagues and do it in a way that was respectful but demonstrating
the emotion that we all felt. So -
QUESTION: Would that be like that video hookup you did with - in -
SECRETARY CLINTON: In Libya? In Tripoli? Probably, yeah.
QUESTION: Would that be one? Or here?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, yeah. I mean, we did so much. We reached out to so many people. I personally did.
QUESTION: And then you of course talked to his sister on the phone and stuff like that.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. So Chris's sister and then went over to - we went out to Andrews early and met all the family
members.
QUESTION: And before you got - somebody told me before you got out of the car on your way to Andrews, you were on the phone
to - which country were you on the phone and said,
"Get your people there"? Oh, Tunisia, because there were attacks still continuing there and saying, "Get your people out there. No
excuses." Was it something like that?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, we had -
QUESTION: Was it something like that? Would that be accurate?
SECRETARY CLINTON: There were a lot of calls like that. We had a lot of threats.
QUESTION: So you had to be kind of a hard-ass.
SECRETARY CLINTON: We had a lot of threats everywhere. So - and remember, in a lot of these places, the security systems
just disappeared after the dictators disappeared. And so there's a difference between some countries where they did not have the
capacity, but they had the will and countries that don't have either the will or the capacity and counties that have the capacity but
without the will. So you have to zero in on what the right message is to each of those.
QUESTION: Well, what can you do if they have the capacity but not the will?
SECRETARY CLINTON: You just have to up the pressure as much as you can.
QUESTION: And how do you do that?
SECRETARY CLINTON: You get everybody you can on the phone, you get everybody calling everybody who needs to be on the
phone, and you basically both appeal to them doing the right thing and threaten them if they don't.
QUESTION: Which country would that have been?
SECRETARY CLINTON: No. No further than that. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Okay. All right. Okay. And then -
STAFF: That piece of paper was the -
QUESTION: That said she has to go? Because I could keep going to get more detail, more detail, more detail. (Laughter.)
STAFF: It's polite. We just set it up that she comes in and gets a blank piece of paper with this - (laughter) -
QUESTION: No, no. I saw it does have something written on it.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. I have to leave for the White House -
QUESTION: I couldn't read it.

SECRETARY CLINTON: -- in about five minutes.
QUESTION: Oh, okay. (Laughter.) I did look. There was something on it, but I couldn't read it, unfortunately, through it.
SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.
QUESTION: Anyway, okay. And then on your legacy, since you didn't really get into that, the one thing is public diplomacy to me
seems to be one part of it — your townterviews and then the secretary of cool thing where you came that — it's all kind of this public
persona.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. Yeah.
QUESTION: The brand of Secretary of State in America. The economic statecraft seemed to me to be part of your —
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right. That's a big part of it.
QUESTION: Okay. And in that —
SECRETARY CLINTON: Internet freedom. I mean, we have a long list we could give you, which I'm sure you could —
QUESTION: And the Asia focus, like going to Beijing, it was one of your last trips, and it was your first trip.
SECRETARY CLINTON: My first trip, absolutely.
QUESTION: And then on the Arab Spring, that was something that you all were involved in and out of Do you feel a little bit's
come back to bite you?
SECRETARY CLINTON: No.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: No. Because I do think that it's — it would be a contortion of who we are not to support people seeking
democracy and freedom and free markets.
QUESTION: Well, everybody said, actually, the day after September 11th that you had the star tone and did better than Obama. I
mean, all the critics thought you — everybody that we talked to thought that, that you had struck the right tone.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, look, I believe strongly that democracy is hard. It is a never-completed journey. I mean, we are
still working hard to make sure we live up to our own ideals and values, and I want to contextualize what's going on in the world. I
mean, these countries have gone frorn oppression of decades without any democratic history into a burst of revolutionary energy to try
to do something they've never done before.
And so it is hard. It's something that is going to take time, and I think the United States remains a beacon of hope and opportunity, an
example of freedom and dignity and human rights, but that doesn't mean we can control everything that happens in every country,
particularly within a revolutionary transition. But I would never have imagined that after something as horrific as the murder of our
four colleagues and the injury of others that you would have a protest — a pro-American protest in Libya demanding that those who
killed Chris Stevens and his colleagues were not the future that Libya wanted. I think that's a remarkable turn of events.
And so we just have to be resolved that we're going to do the best we can to stand for our values, protect ourselves in a dangerous,
fast changing world, and manage as best we can this enormous flood of change that is sweeping across the globe. But with that I'm
going to have to —
QUESTION: Okay. I understand.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- head to the White House.
QUESTION: Gotcha.
SECRETARY CLINTON: All right, my dear.
QUESTION: Okay. Thank you very much.

PS: here's the last one I sent, with an attachment of the earlier one
Cheryl, I'm resending a message that I first sent on April 14. I can imagine how flooded your inbox is, but I'd be grateful
if you could give me some idea of whether what I'm proposing below might work. If there's any chance, I'll send you the
full list of people from the Board and Intl Advisory Council.
BTW, I've heard terrific reports about the Sec's Town Meeting in Iraq yesterday, including from my friend
who I gather is slated to go to as ambassador. He's as good as they get.
One other thing (speaking of ambassadorships), I'm concerned about what I gather may happen with regard to the
Tokyo embassy—not least because the Japanese are getting concerned. I realize the locus of decision-making there is
the White House, but given the terrific start the HRC gave to the US-Japan relationship by going to Tokyo first on her trip
to Asia, I'd be sorry to see any, setback there.
Here follows my earlier message....
Hi, Cheryl. I wanted to take a quiet sounding with you about possibly getting a bit of time for the Brookings board of
trustees and International Advisory Council on June 4. If there's any possibility at all, I'll come in, via any channel you
suggest, with a formal request, but here's the essence of it: we've got a very distinguished board which she's met with
before (a week after the 2004 election), plus a group of 20+ high-level international types
etc.). We could do it in a way that minimizes the imposition on her time—i.e., bring the group into the
department an assemble in the Loy Henderson auditorium (or whatever it's called these days, or a similar 1st floor
venue), and she comes down and talks to us for 15 minutes and take 15 minutes of questions, over and out. We did this

with Condi and it worked well. Just so you'll know, we'll be having dinner that night with Ban Ki-Moon, and they'll be
having sessions with Kissinger and with someone high up either in the Intel Community or Defense.
Regards—and congrats on how well things seem to be going.

they're seeking an audience... Very late notice I told them BUT they have about a hundred here from all over the globe
and they are our Methodists... I had the Bishop send me the details and I contact number. Attached below. I left it very

Dear Burns,
It was good to talk with you again this morning. I am grateful for your willingness to help the Council of Bishops. The
following are dates and times that are available:
Sunday, May 3, 6:00 PM dinner - This is the opening dinner for the Council in which all of the bishops will be present. It
will be at the American University Katzman Arts Center (right on the Nebraska Circle).
Wednesday, May 6, 6:00 PM dinner - Again all of the bishops will be present. This dinner will be at the Bethesda Hyatt,
7400 Wisconsin Avenue.

Another option is on Tuesday, May 6, any time between 2:00 and 4 PM with a group of bishops who are available to
come to the State Department.
Also a group of bishops are available for breakfast or lunch Tuesday through Thursday.
Our first hope is either the Sunday or Wednesday for dinner.
You or someone on behalf of Secretary Clinton can call me at If you could call or email me today to let me
know how the initial call went.

John and Burns, Great talking to you both this evening.
Burns, the United Methodist Bishops from around the world are coming to the Washington area for a weeklong
gathering of bishops. Bishop John is host and arranging their schedule. John can tell you more details ...
it would be wonderful if a time could be found sometime during the week
(Sunday-Friday) for Hillary to meet with the entire group of bishops (around 100 total) or at least the leaders of the
African bishops (perhaps a group of 10 or so).

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758447 Date: 06/30/2015
John notes that the group can be flexible and accomodate Hillary's busy schedule. He suggests that there are a couple
of ideal evening opportunities where all the bishops will be present: this Sunday evening at 6 pm at American
University's Arts Center, or Wednesday at 6 pm at the Hyatt in Bethesda. There also is a Tuesday evening gathering and
reception with just the African bishops -- 7 pm onwards at AP Shaw UMC in SE DC.
If it is not possible for her to go to the bishops, I wonder whether it might be possible for a smaller group (eg, John, the
African bishops and a couple others) to come to the State Department for a meeting in the Secretary's suite or
conference room on the 7th floor. The Secretary obviously has a very busy schedule, but it might well be possible to find
20-30 minutes sometime during the week at the Department. (I haven't yet done so, but I will check the State Dept
website and see what her announced travel schedule is.)
I am happy to help however I can, though it probably is easiest if you coordinate directly. Feel free to copy me at the
above emails if I can be helpful. Here are your cell numbers: Bishop John's is
Burns's is
God's blessings to you both,

I hope this note finds you and your family doing well. I've been following all of your activities over the last several
months. You are doing an incredible job, which I'm sure is a surprise to no one. I'm going to be in DC May 19-21. We
have our annual gathering out there with about 150 folks coming out from the Exchange. I know this is probably a long

Congresswoman's son-in-law dies snorkeling
August 12, 2009 4:29 PM I UPDATED STORY
The son-in-law of U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-III.) died Sunday in a snorkeling accident as he vacationed in Mexico with
his family, her office and family said.
Michael McLaughlin, 38, was with Schakowsky and other family members near Tulum, Mexico, at the beginning of a
week long vacation, Schakowsky's husband Robert Creamer said.
McLaughlin was married to Lauren, 35, who is the daughter of Schakowsky's husband and his previous wife Day Piercy,
who lives in New York.
McLaughlin was a filmmaker and editor who lived with his wife in Queens, N.Y.
Creamer said he and other family members were in their hotel near Solinon Bay when another guest with binoculars
told them there appeared to be a problem with McLaughlin, who was snorkeling in the bay about 7 miles north of
Tul urn.
Creamer was the first to reach McLaughlin in a kayak. He said he found his son-in-law face down in the water, and called
out to him but got no response. Creamer said he got closer, turned his son-in-law over and realized he was in trouble. He
administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and put a life vest on him, Creamer said.
""I yelled at him and poked at him and got no response, so I turned him over and it was clear he wasn't breathing," said
Creamer.
McLaughlin's wife then showed up along with Schakowsky and others in more kayaks to help put McLaughlin on a kayak
in the nearly 7-feet of water. Others also arrived in more kayaks to assist and pulled the craft carrying McLaughlin onto
the beach where they continued to try to revive him unsuccessfully.
McLaughlin was pronounced dead at a local hospital a short time later, Creamer said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759603 Date: 06/30/2015
In a phone interview from Mexico, Creamer said McLaughlin was an experienced snorkeler and diver who liked to
snorkel alone, a coroner's report said he had aspirated in his mask and died of asphyxiation, he said.
McLaughlin was cremated, following his own request, Creamer said.
Creamer described himself as heartbroken and praised his son-in-law and the 7-year marriage to his daughter. The
couple had planned to adopt their first child in September.
"Michael was one of the most loving and creative people I've ever met.... and he and my daughter Lauren had one of
the most loving marriages I have ever seen," Creamer said.
In 2005 Schakowsky's daughter-in-law Fiona died of cancer. She had been married to Schakowsky's son Ian.
Born Oct. 26, 1970, in Berkeley, Calif., McLaughlin was the oldest of three children and grew up in "the shadow of Mount
Tamalpais, in Mann County," according to Creamer.
As a young man, McLaughlin was known for his love for the outdoors as his dinner table quips that entertained his
family. As a young adult, he attended Sarah Lawrence College where he studied theater and moved with a friend to New
York City, following college.
His family said McLaughlin never lost his zest for adventure, regularly white water rafting, skydiving, backpacking and
studying Karate.
McLaughlin later moved to San Francisco, where he met his wife Lauren and married her in July 2002. During their
marriage, McLaughlin helped his wife start her own business and she helped him pursue his film career as a filmmaker,
his family said.
During McLaughlin's career he worked in live theater, puppetry and short fiction. His short film "Shadow Puppets of
Doom" was shown in film festivals and won the "Best Screenplay" award in the Mann County Film Festival, his family
said. At the time of his death he was filming a pilot reality television show.
McLaughlin is survived by his wife, Lauren Creamer McLaughlin, his mother, Rohana, his sister, Halima, and his brother,
Marlin.

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The ""surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick up on—
the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed information about
Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of things that have been covered
in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and much more focused on Branch than I
had anticipated. While not as "and this day, and the next day" as My Life, it does share many of the same elements that
would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that there appears to be no index also makes it difficult
for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore, WIC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection
through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC quotes was far fewer than I had expected.
HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with Branch
when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the Gephardt comment,
and didn't grab much attention at all.[1] (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought that there should not be a
special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much aligned with her interactions with
Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in the book are those, which face the current
Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015

Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion of the
Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his connection with the
events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are strikingly sparsely discussed
such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not appear as thought WJC ever-dodged
questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life, one theme that repeated itself was WJC's
conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few
instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there
are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on
more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch could
write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends, later quashed,
who slept over while NBC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does portray a helpful distinction in
how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have
him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are
some quips that could catch someone's eye, such as WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't
even recognize."
Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no other
lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason he didn't
mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if she was found to
be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a very small passage that
could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this before. (This is addressed more
fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship with Gore,
which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with Janet Reno. The
one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues are discussed in turn
below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed in a much more human light
than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her relationship with CVC and images of
affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.
On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans, China, Russia,
Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about Haiti is about Branch's own
experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion about North Korea, but nothing that has
not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in what seems to track mention of him in My Life,
which seems to have more detail and background than this book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the USSS
cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets would be lined

with "assassins." There are candid looks at WIC's take on certain people and the relationship between some, such as
Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's drinking, such as yelling outside of
Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders going, but
Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained interpretation of
the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Life only mentions Lee's
accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from Branch's book the first giving context
and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security agencies,
indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his personal computer. Lee
was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown, solitary confinement—even though the
long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to China or anyone else. The president said experts were
telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged.
Nothing would please him more than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
0 While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret, uncharged and
untried...He [WIC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without foreseeing such arbitrary
detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the legal limit...whether to bring charges on the
testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for
more than six months. One extreme detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American.
We accept guilty people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom." [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could send her
to jail, as she had denied it.
0 "Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of the affair. If
Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could have turned him into a
witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while original, struck me as tendentious. The
president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of
Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.
0 There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he complained that
if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to say "it was interesting, in fact,
that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet,
announcing gladly that his worries were over because the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she
replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She
said Kissing blanched, speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered
that his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,' Hillary
repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life." [Branch, 179]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
HRC and gay/lesbian
Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how W1C's counsel got very "exercised." WJC left the room. "He
was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life than Hillary.' He sighed. Her
temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues were even mentionable. New York
politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take. On the other hand, personal experience
could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with Moynihan.
For example:
0 When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could fight for
themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a freebie for him,' snapped
Clinton, 'and he knows it." [p.140]
0 In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WIC] faulted Senator Moynihan for aimless
hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]
0 Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a number of
them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was sure they had nothing to
hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely on the surface, never
produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny himself for five minutes, living in an apartment
secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182]
0 "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted hypothetical
about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, "He doesn't understand...that he's conceding the principles."
WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press and said that Moynihan knew what he
was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption about Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several examples
follow:
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the Clintons, with
the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room...Their agenda was a delicate race between Hussein's
failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of
national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed
electrical grids, and so on. Hussein gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch, 170]
0 South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule was far more demanding than
ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden women." [Branch, 236] Later
Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast with a superficial American press, which portrayed
Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords
with whirlwind encouragements for citizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting
Bhutto corresponds to a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, "she [HRC] played the traditional role of
First Lady as wife and mother...") [Branch, 246]
0 China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she depicted the
"harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the rave reviews of HRC's speech.
[Branch, 289]
0 Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed from urgent political
tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact with her
throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs gratitude, but the
fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.
0 "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called Chelsea at
Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was another story. Jesse said he
knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in American politics. He did not know everything
involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now
above all, and if she needed to counsel, rage, or pray, he was always available." [Branch, 497]
Tension with Janet Reno
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative opinion of
Janet Reno.
0 "He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney general. If he
removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall
to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's wholesale devotion to outside control for any
case in which the president himself may become a target...lf he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would
touch off a firestorm of protest like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the
Watergate scandal. That was not an option." [Branch, 388-389]
0 Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and continuing to
allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy. Branch then outlines a meeting
between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her "desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like
that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I
hired her to work for me." [Branch, 398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good
achievements including coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on
Whitewater, but that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno had failed to
defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension the entire executive
branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her more naïve than upright, and the
fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch, 399] He cites that Clinton warned her that she should prepare
herself for not staying in the job for the entire second term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter
There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to North Korea
and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be on the front lines.
North Korea:
0 "On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore, and Clinton had
approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme isolation...Sure enough, Carter did reach North
Korean dictator Kim II-sung, who proposed to allow inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief
from the harsh economic sanctions. The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became
official, adding gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters, and he did not
believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt." [Branch, 1621
Haiti:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with Gore (who said
Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to Haiti to seek a truce with the
junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis' (arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus
what was in the United States' best interest). He didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North
Korea, Carter again, Carter went to the press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and
Carter, invited to stay over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the
next morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not right...The
press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent negotiators... He said the
current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that
Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with
restraint at their joint press conference, he allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he
had earned the right to speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the
United States government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-resident." [Branch,
200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
0 "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush. 'Dole will
support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he doesn't have much positive to
say." [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places where he is
briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the seemingly brutally candid
conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.
0 On page 92 Branch writes, "No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as alleged, but to
improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin." [Branch, 92]
0 In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also having Gore
substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other nations were offended that
Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to redeem himself and the administration for his
absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC "pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked.
So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to
take these exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and
were still wrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as a team to
secure the Cabinet for the second term.
0 Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second criminal
lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is about a leak of an offer
from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free. The exchange is more on ethics of the
offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
0 On Gore's announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his kickoff events—
once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were technical...But Gore got all the big
things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly
what he would do for them in the White House. The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third,
Gore would be badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post." [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues that
WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his campaign. "On tape, the president said he
confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must
project his platform—where he stood, precisely how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans
would try to knock him off substance." [Branch, 554]
0 WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not succeeding
him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart, experience, and motivated.
He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential character over detailed agendas for the
country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," but Clinton discounted this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would
wear well over time. Gore also was perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence,
which called for Gore to emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a
brooding quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature failed to
give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch, 599]
0 He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said the
president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had it not been for the vice
president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who would be a bright spot to run with,
perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though
she would never get chosen. How much of this was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is
unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
0 WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be running essentially for a
third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would tarnish them with Clinton's
character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate that had been heard before—that Gore lacked
style and a light touch.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in one of their
stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he meant good on the policy,
and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend the two. Gore said he had to think about
it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the
message that Clinton must convey somehow without seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch, 623-624]
0 The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure at first
about recording the details. At the outset it says, "For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did he blame Clinton for his
defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him did." [Branch, 642] It has WJC
acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the White House. Then he says, "I think you made a
mistake not to use me more in the last ten days," Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much
more upset about your message, now that we're being honest." [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought
bag saying that "Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an "unparalleled" vice president, but that
he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was "surreal."
o Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal had been
the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers
had tormented him now for four years. Gore said he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered
telling the president that he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for trouble. So he did
blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be
in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought he was in Neverland,' he said." [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported Clinton all through
the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated
that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened.
There was little to say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake. He
had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis. Well, he said, this is the first
time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed.
Their colliding perspectives made both of them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so
significant here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed honesty that
somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..." [Branch, 644-45]
Other
0 Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking Maggie to compile
confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. "Williams was shrewd, discreet, and efficient." [Branch, 161]
HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's suggestion to invade
Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the pressure, the lack of options, and his

sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign policy staff. He said she observed with some
suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake, Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed
the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray Inman as defense secretary." [Branch, 189]
0 ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book. Quinn said that
HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn. HRC said Feinman had withdrawn
from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be
about him and how it affected him as a ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor
that HRC and a female veterinarian of Socks' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House."
[Branch, 342-343]
0 Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had subpoenaed all
those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were there. This included "some two
dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed the subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]
0 Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, "In our glancing
associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as lighthearted or
recreational." [Branch, 495]
0 Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their best chance
to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, 'but I don't think Al would ever do it." [Branch, 540]
WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting HRC if she
decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the two events are unconnected.
"When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He .
could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..." [Branch, 557]
0 On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because "of hard intelligence
that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses the cancelled trip but does
not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.

For Secretary Clinton
Dear Hillary,
You will remember our initiative to bring the most senior retired generals from the Chinese and US militaries. With
these 10 generals from the two countires, I am going to be in DC on October 21 and 22. these Generals have been part
our of our Sanya Initiative - the unofficial mil-mil dialogue I started last year. It'll be me, Joe Prueher, Charley Wilhelm,
Ron Fogleman, and Denny Reimer. The Chinese will be led by General Xiong Guangkai and include four other very senior
and respected Generals from the PLA.
The Chinese view this as a formal track one program and take it very seriously. We will meet with ADM Mullen and ADM
Keating in Honolulu and see GEN Cartwright at the Pentagon. It would be a terrific sign of the U.S.'s support for this
relationship if you were able join or host (I'd be pleased to fund) a very private dinner on the evening of the 21 or the
22nd of October. Just you, the Generals, and interpreters - perhaps the Chinese Ambassador if you think that would be
valuable.
I met with Kurt Campbell last month, and we will meet with him and Jim Steinberg. He expressed strong support for this
dialogue as well as the economic one we started in Beijing last August. You know we would welcome involvement from
State at any of our projects - our goal is to make a small but meaningful difference in the relationship.
Warm best wishes, (I'm cheering for you!)

Hillary,
I admire the way you handled yourself during your trip to Pakistan. It reminds me of the daunting job before you and it's
potential.
Successfully engaging the power of the DOS and the array of relevant external relationships on behalf of your goals will
remain a central challenge.
As we discussed, gathering a handful of loyal and trusted outside advisors could provide a valuable tool in this regard.
Given your late October or early November target for the first meeting, I have been working with Cheryl to come up with
a date. I guess given all that is going on possible dates seem to continually slip away.
I would understand if, in the context of everything on your plate this advisory group is just not practical. However, if you
do feel that such a gathering would be helpful and want to proceed, I believe you need to step in, select the initial date
or dates (with risk that it may need to change) and extend the invitations. A quick note to Mickey, Gordon, Maggie and
any others you want to include. Others mentioned so far include Sandy Berger, Strobe Talbott and Elaine Kamarck.
For at least the first gathering, you may want to consider two parts. A dinner, breakfast or other informal event plus a
more structured meeting would create the opportunity for informal discussion and time for reflection.
In the event you do want to move forward, I am happy to assist in any way that may be useful. Please know that I in no
way want to push this beyond where you may want to go.
Nancy

Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the World By Joe Klein Time Magazine Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009
It was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. ""We're prepared to start
peace talks immediately," the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton standing at his side, poker-faced. "I think we should ... get on it and get with it."
It was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their
leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West
Bank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a
partial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was
a nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an "unprecedented" offer,
Netanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)
It was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had
softened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli
"restraint" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat, agreeing that
Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, "unprecedented," even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most
important thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the
Palestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab
neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan "falls far short" of
U.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it "unprecedented," which was neither diplomatic nor wise.
Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on
Netanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,
privately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talks
without preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton
had violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.)
Clinton's Three Qualities
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
For the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go
to Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there "guardedly optimistic" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the
Israelis or Palestinians move a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The
breakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go to
Jerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and
reach what appears to be a breakthrough — they're talking! — which then becomes another dead end.
The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,
is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,
diplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the
National Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors have
distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was
Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James
Baker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have
been frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about — the second most popular American in
the world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking
headline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.
It is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The
conventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton's
reticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the
heavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she
becomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.
Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the
Obama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum
looms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?
Traditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the
striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign
indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian
idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem
indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.
There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of
departmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy
— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the
office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand
and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an
international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to
the President's — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.
She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although
her performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed
tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,
Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems
far more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton's
campaign.)
Independence and Candor
In the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the
behest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.
In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
independence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after
an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — "Can't we all just get along?" — phase.
During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been
unprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan
specialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had
been bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. "We
saw her praying there," an academic named Shala Aziz told me, "and, for the first time, I'm thinking, The Americans have
hearts."(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)
The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts
and Pashtun elders — and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the
Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press
accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton's
undiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,
had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the
Pakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast
was especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez
Musharraf. "In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home," said Farahnaz
Ispahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. "Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile
or not, has made a big impression — and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it
means so much more."
Transformative Experience
There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and
Clinton's — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.
Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album
of photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and
daughter Chelsea. "It did bring tears to my eyes," Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,
"because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..." She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,
talking about the "reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all."
Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I
believe, of the process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when
we set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994
congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very
personal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.
Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was
Chelsea's spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy
czar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously
ridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NG0s.
"That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable," Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her
Jerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing
glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. "I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I've
done since," she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.
Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: "Women's rights are human
rights."(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)
Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years
of insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.
When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside

Bhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. "She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar
kameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did
anything like that," Clinton says.
When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because
Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking
Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, "I used to be able
to walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can't." When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —
"The Saudis," who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, and
participation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so
inadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)
Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education and
health care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State
Department but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones —
schools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result, there
was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army's counterinsurgency
manual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At
one point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential
Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, "You mean, aside from Hillary?"
It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke ("my two alpha males," she calls them) for the first time —
at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the
military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than
usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In
fact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.
Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID
director, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. "It was all sorts of niggling things," says a Clinton adviser, "like, Farmer had
at one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the
amount was illegal."
Another of Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, "I'm a Republican. I disagree with her
about practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief." There is a palpable toughness to the
woman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest
exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the "bluster" of George W. Bush
after she said the U.S. would be able to "obliterate" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tone
has been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli
settlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted "to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not
outposts, not natural-growth exceptions." And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a
rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read "Clinton's Collateral Damage.")
The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps
removed from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:
whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of
the room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the
de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.
Hillary's Choice
The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in
substantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is
willing to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;
neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
perception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems
ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there's no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain
recalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on
human rights with no apparent quid pro quos.
The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will
return to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for "strategic patience." But the only thing Obama
really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have
refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force —
the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this
Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of U.S. power. That doesn't happen
overnight, but for Obama's policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be
explained to the public.
There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which
represents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but
in his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace
hunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;
if it doesn't, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is
accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. "You can't be seen pushing countries around — demanding
[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results," says Leslie
H. Gelb, author of Power Rules. "The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they'll begin to take
you less seriously." (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)
Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise
for the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also
burblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for
the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the
uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.
These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that
the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New
York, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,
though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President's
primary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials
have spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. "Either
you have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President," says a former
Republican Secretary of State, "or there is no message."(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)
Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged
that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television
is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely
guarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President's alter ego
on foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates — but he's a
Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones
has settled in as National Security Adviser, but he's not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign
policy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.
Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning
the $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. "How much damage control
have you been able to do on this trip?" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton's
meeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. "I don't know," she
said. "I hope some."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. "Well, this trip was long overdue," she said. "The Pakistani
people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone
attacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the
damage control" — she paused, thinking it through — "I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot."
In the end, though, Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.
She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who
knows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.

Madam Secretary-
I hope you, the President and Chelsea had a great Thanksgiving. Hopefully things will wind down and you'll be able to
spend some time with your family. As you know, I'm being honored by the American Friends of the Hebrew University
on Thursday, March 11, 2010. I'd be so honored if you would consider being the keynote speaker. I've had some
correspondence with Lona in your office and she indicated you may have a better idea of your 2010 calendar in early
November. It would mean the world to me if you could do it, but if not I completely understand.
I look forward to seeing you soon.
All my best,
Terry

Subject: Congratulations!
Francisco,
Just wanted to congratulate you and the entire team on a striking success. The Secretary's visit was jaw-dropping from
the Mexican perspective. I have never seen such a positive reaction to a visit by a high ranking US government
official. My personal favorite: Estamos hillarizados por estos dias.
There is obviously also a ""show me the money" aspect of the reaction, but even Mexico's newspaper of the traditionally
anti-American left editorialized about "Good Clinton, Bad Napolitano".
And inside President Calderon's circle they are thrilled with Wednesday's meeting.
Many congratulations.
OK, I will stop bothering you with my emails and allow you to get back to doing your job.
warm regards,
Pamela

Dear Francisco,
I am sorry we did not have the chance to chat last week prior to the dinner, although I did see you at the end of the
table so now at least have a face in my head to go with your name.
I am writing you in the "follow-up" spirit that Sec. Clinton presented at the end of the dinner. I thought that a few
insights gleaned from having been in Mexico all this week might be of use to the secretary, although after my breakfast
with Leslie Bassett on Wednesday I am more convinced than ever that the Secretary is receiving high quality
information about Mexico from her embassy here. So there may not be that much for me to add, nevertheless...
I had breakfast Thursday with President Calderon's main foreign policy adviser, Rafael Fernandez de Castro, a very old
and good friend. He made two points I think are worth relaying to you and Anne-Marie:
1)As I mentioned at dinner, Mexico is impatient and President Calderon frustrated (more so now after the trucking
spat). To the extent that secretary Clinton can bring something tangible -- a sort of down payment on the kind of
relationship we would like to build with Mexico -- it would help enormously. In that context, Rafael reminded me that
President Calderon would very much like to be remembered as Mexico's first "Green President" (and is in something of a
competition with the Mayor of mexico City on this score).
2) rafael also related a very useful conceptuilization of President Calderon the man that I think will be of use to you:
he is a social conservative, Mexican nationalist (which by definition carries with it some anti-US sentiments) but also
harbors profound liberal values -- he is a true democrat (not all Mexican politicians are) and a strong supporter of free
trade and of a market economy that is largely free but regulated where required (which by definition carries some
sympathy for US values and Democratic party values), it is this dichotomy that defines him as a person and makes him
intelligible as a politician.
I also met with two female Senators who suggested to me the possibility of arranging a meeting between Sec. Clinton
and Mexico's female governors (2) and senators (about 20). In an obviously male-dominated society, they have been
working hard to promotewomen's issues and they think that the symbolism of a meeting with the secretary would help
their cause enormously. I agreed to pass the suggestion along in part becasue I am impressed by how these women --
from political parties that otherwise find it very hard to collaborate -- are cooperating across party lines to promote
women's issues, this kind of cross-party cooperation is much less common than it ought to be in Mexico's still formative
democracy. And it is obviously in the US interest to encourage this kind of behavior and thereby help solidify democratic
practices in Mexico. I know it is very late in your trip-planning to make this suggestion, but if there is not time for such
a meeting this trip, maybe for the next one.
I hope these musings were of some use.
Warm regards,
Pamela

'Renegade' CliffsNotes
By: Jonathan Martin
June 2, 2009 12:22 AM EST
The flood of books devoted to the 2008 campaign and President Barack Obama begins in
earnest this week with the release of ""Renegade, The Making of a President," by former
Newsweek reporter Richard Wolfe.
Wolffe's account of the Obama campaign isn't to be officially released until Tuesday, but
POLITICO obtained a copy earlier this week.
Herewith are some of the book's most fascinating nuggets:
No Shrum Moment:
Before the election had been called, but when it looked promising for Obama the then-
candidate called his top adviser, David Axelrod.
"What's going on?" Obama asked.
"Look, I'm not going to say congratulations yet, but boy, it looks awfully good," Axelrod
replied.
Axelrod, Wolfe notes, wanted to avoid a repeat of 2004, when John Kerry's top adviser,
Bob Shrum, told the Massachusetts senator prematurely on election night that he wanted
to be the first to say, "Mr. President."
Pritzker Veers Off-Message (A little):
The impressive fundraising Obama demonstrated in 2007 was largely a result of the usual
high-dollar contributors — not the small-dollar donors the campaign liked to hold up to the
press.
"It wasn't the Internet," admitted Penny Pritzker, Obama's national finance chair.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761505 Date: 06/30/2015
Talking To Himself:
The revamped stump speech Obama gave to Iowa Democrats at their Jefferson-Jackson
Dinner in November of 2007 was borne out of a speech Obama scribe Jon Favreau had
written for the candidate earlier that month in South Carolina.
Favreau trimmed the original version and sent it to Obama who had to memorize it for
what became a pivotal moment leading up to the Iowa caucuses.
Aides were concerned that Obama was not prepared to give the speech, but he largely
got it right on his first run-through a day befOre the dinner.
The Politico 44 Story Widget Requires Adobe Flash Player.
"None of Obama's aides knew that the candidate had been rehearsing in his Des Moines
hotel room all week," Wolfe writes. [Press secretary Robert] Gibbs had walked by his
room a couple of times, heard a loud television behind the door, and wondered what was
going on. Obama had turned the volume up to practice the speech to himself, out of sight
and earshot of even his closest staff."
Michelle As Strategist:
The morning after Obama lost the early-March Ohio and Texas primaries, campaign
manager David Plouffe suffered through an uncomfortable car ride with the candidate and
his wife, Michelle Obama.
The future first lady, writes Wolfe, "threatened not to return to the campaign trail until they
had come up with a new strategy."
Says Plouffe: "I think she was pissed at both of us."
A Rev. Wright Sit-down:
After Obama gave his race speech in Philadelphia primary but before his former pastor,
the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, would make his now-infamous appearance at the National
Press Club, the candidate went to Chicago to meet with Wright.
Obama was trying to dissuade Wright from a "comeback tour" and told his former pastor to
expect a "media circus" if he reemerged.
Wright, Wolfe writes, wanted to tell his side of the story and felt like he was "the aggrieved
party."
Tough Words For Bill Clinton:
His wife is now Obama's secretary of state, but Obama had some tough words for the
120

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761505 Date: 06/30/2015
actions of former President Bill Clinton during the campaign.
"We had to figure out how to deal with a former president who was just lying, engaging in
bald-faced lies," Obama explained to Wolfe.
When the then-candidate was asked if Clinton got in his head, he replied: "Yes, but I got
into his."
Later, when considering who to name as his running mate, Obama told aides that if Hillary
Clinton would help politically she ought to be considered.
"But I'm concerned about Bill Clinton being a loose cannon," Obama said, according to
Wolfe.
Joe Biden Wants His Damn Calls Returned
When Sen. John McCain wouldn't return the phone calls of Sen. Joe Biden, the never-
subtle Delawarean sought out his longtime colleague.
In New York City with Obama and McCain where the two were both appearing at a public
service event on the anniversary of 9/11, Biden was rebuffed by McCain's aides
backstage when he asked to see the GOP nominee.
So, Wolfe writes, Biden went to McCain's green room door and knocked.
"John McCain,' he shouted, according to Wolfe. "It's Joe Biden. The next time I phone
you, take the damn call."
Rendell Drinks The Obama Kool-Aid — Literally
After Obama locked up the nomination, Pennsylvania Gov. and ardent Clinton supporter
Ed Rendell got a note from an Obama supporter attached to a can of Kool-Aid telling him
to drink up.
So the next day at a Philadephla fundraiser for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, the
ever-demonstrative governor poured it into a glass of water and proclaimed: "Now I feel
that Senator Obama is the most wonderful person ever to have lived in the United States
of America. The smartest, most sensitive most decent and honorable man. Now I
understand what you guys have been feeling for the last six months."
"The Old Man":
Plouffe told Wolfe that they never considered going after the 72-year-old McCain on his
age, but the author notes that some in Obama's high command enjoyed references to the
GOP nominee's age and one staffer had a nickname for the Republican: "the old man."

Re: The Berlusconi assault
1. The physical attack on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is a major political event in Italy and Europe. His
assailant is a mentally disturbed man without a political agenda who has been in and out of psychiatric care since he was
18 years old. Nonetheless, the assault has significant repercussions. It has generated sympathy for Berlusconi as a
victim—he has been obviously injured, lost two teeth and a pint of blood, and doctors will keep him in the hospital for
perhaps a week for observation. The attack comes as Berlusconi was beginning to lose political footing, having lost his
legal immunity. One court inquiry is turning up evidence of his links to the Mafia while another is examining his role in
the bribery case of British lawyer David Mills. Berlusconi's government and party have used the attack as a way to turn
the sudden sympathy for him to his advantage, claiming that his opponents have sown a climate of ""hate." Through
demogogic appeals they are attempting to discredit and rebuff the legal proceedings against him and undermine the
investigative press. (Berlusconi is suing La Repubblica, the large independent newspaper in Rome that has been most
aggressive in digging into his affairs of all kind.)
2. It would seem proper and decent for the President to call Berlusconi to express his concern about his health and
wish him a speedy recovery, if he hasn't done so already. There are many reasons for Obama to do this, not least to
condemn violence against a democratically elected head of state. It would be awkward for the U.S. President not to call
a Western head of state of a NATO country who has been physically harmed. Berlusconi, for his part, would certainly

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761507 Date: 06/30/2015
make such a call public. It would therefore also be awkward if a call were used only as an element in his sympathy
campaign against the court proceedings. •
3. If so, there is a larger message that should be communicated, perhaps by the President in his conversation, but
most importantly through a statement from the State Department, also conveyed by the U.S. ambassador in Italy. The
USG condemns any and all violence as an assault on democracy. By the same measure, this incident involving an
apparently deranged individual should not be exploited to raise social tensions. Instead, it should inspire reflection on
the necessity of every citizen to adhere to the rule of law as well as to respect freedom of speech and the press.
4. Two articles on the legal inquries into Berlusconi below:
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/worldieurope/berlusconi-cut-deal-with-mafia-court-told-1834647.html
Berlusconi 'cut deal with Mafia', court told Former hitman claims Italian PM gave 'benefits' to the Mob for political
support By Michael Day in Milan Saturday, 5 December 2009 The Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, made a deal
with the Sicilian Mafia in the early 1990s that put the country "in the hands" of the Mob, a court in Turin was told
yesterday.
Gaspare Spatuzza, a jailed Mafia hitman turned witness, told a packed and heavily guarded bunker courtroom that his
Cosa Nostra Godfather boss had cut a deal with Mr Berlusconi in 1993 that provided unspecified "benefits" to the Mafia
in exchange for political support. The media tycoon entered politics a few months later and won his first term as Prime
Minister in 1994.
Spatuzza said his boss, Giuseppe Graviano, who was jailed over Mafia bomb attacks in Rome, Milan and Florence, had
told him that the Mob had "got everything" with the help of Mr Berlusconi, adding that Graviano called Mr Berlusconi
"the man from Channel 5", in reference to his TV network.
The damaging claims came at the appeal hearing of Marcello Dell'Utri, a key Berlusconi associate and senator, who is
challenging his nine-year jail sentence for links with the Mafia.
Spatuzza, in prison for several murders, testified: "Graviano told me the name of Berlusconi and said that thanks to him
and the man from our home town [an apparent reference to Dell' Utri] we have the country in our hands."
Mr Berlusconi has denounced the claims of Spatuzza as "vile", and "unfounded and defamatory", denying ever having
links with the Mafia. The Prime Minister's spokesman said the testimony yesterday was the Mafia's "completely logical"
revenge against the Prime Minister for his "determined" fight against organised crime.
Dell'Utri told the court that neither he nor Mr Berlusconi had Mafia connections. "It's in the interest of the Mafia to
force the collapse of the Berlusconi government because this government has done the most in the fight against
organised crime," he said. Mr Berlusconi, who recently lost his legal immunity to prosecution, was said to have been
furious this week, after the parliamentary Speaker, Gianfranco Fini, the man who is supposed to be his closest ally, had
said that the Spatuzza evidence was "an atomic bomb".
Mr Fini was recorded by an unobserved microphone while talking privately at an official dinner. Rumours of the
conservative Prime Minister's links with the Mob have persisted since investigators learnt that a Cosa Nostra hitman,
Vittorio Mangano, worked as Mr Berlusconi's "stable-master" at the media mogul's villa in Arcore outside Milan in the
1970s. Much speculation has also centred on the origins of Mr Berlusconi's vast wealth.
Last week, the Prime Minister's broadcast group, Mediaset, and his holding company, Fininvest, announced it intended
to sue the left-wing newspaper La Repubblica over an article that said Mediaset was "20 per cent owned by the Mafia".
La Stampa newspaper noted that the "dread combination of Mafia allegations and separation from his wife are now his
principal torments". Mr Berlusconi's estranged wife, Veronica Lario, is said to be seeking a £3m-a-month divorce
settlement, and a messy courtroom battle looms. Mr Berlusconi also faces a retrial on the charge that he bribed the
British lawyer David Mills to lie in court.

After a Court Ruling, Berlusconi's Legal Woes Resume By Jeff Israely The world has spent the past six months wondering
how — and with whom — Silvio Berlusconi spends his Saturday nights. But the combative, scandal-plagued Prime
Minister of Italy would prefer to talk about his mornings instead. "Do you know how I've been forced to spend my
Saturday mornings since I entered politics?" Berlusconi once declared to business leaders in Rome. "With my lawyers."

Italy's self-proclaimed Defendant in Chief makes a point of lamenting all those weekends spoiled by stacks of court
dossiers as further proof that he is the victim of politically motivated magistrates, whom he called during the same
speech "the spreading cancer of our democracy." (See Berlusconi's worst gaffes.)
<http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1874098_1874099_1874118,00.html>
To combat such perceived persecution, Berlusconi has tested the bounds of decorous democratic conduct, including his
allies' pushing a bill through Parliament last year that gave him and other top Italian officeholders immunity from
prosecution. But since the Constitutional Court overturned that law in October, several criminal investigations into
Berlusconi's business dealings have been reopened, with other new charges rumored to be looming.
The potentially most damaging trial is set to resume Friday, Dec. 4, in Milan, with the 73-year-old billionaire being
accused of paying British attorney David Mills $600,000 in 1997 to withhold incriminating evidence about his
broadcasting empire Mediaset. Mills is appealing a conviction in the same case; both men have denied any wrongdoing.
So, alas, Berlusconi is back to spending his downtime with a well-paid cadre of more than a dozen avvocati, who have
been successful so far in keeping their biggest client clear of criminal convictions. Not that the lawyers have ever really
gone away. Since the media baron first ran for office 15 years ago, his legal advisers have doubled as political consiglieri,
key members of Parliament and even important Cabinet Ministers. Indeed, while some critics have spoken of
Berlusconi's reign as a kind of sultanate of showgirls or government by gaffe, others have described it as a republic of
attorneys. (See what Berlusconi's Obama "jokes" say about Italy.)
<http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1927307,00.html>
His longtime lawyer Cesare Previti served as Italian Defense Minister during Berlusconi's first term in 1994 before being
convicted of corruption himself (and losing twice on appeal). During Berlusconi's second term (2001-06), Gaetano
Pecorella, a former leftist, served as president of Parliament's Justice Commission, where he was instrumental in
shepherding through new laws that helped shield Berlusconi from investigating magistrates.
Giovanni Sartori, a Columbia University professor of constitutional law, says the role Berlusconi's personal lawyers have
played in his legislative agenda is yet another gargantuan conflict of interest to add to those related to his ownership of
Italy's main private television stations. But by now, Sartori says, Berlusconi's lawyers have perfected the art of exploiting
Italy's painfully slow justice system: many cases conclude without a final verdict because the statute of limitations has
been reached. "It is more a mania than a necessity," Sartori says of Berlusconi's near obsession in battling magistrates.
"He feels persecuted, and fighting the judges is what makes him happy."
Berlusconi's current point man is Nicolo Ghedini, a somber-faced, lanky 49-year-old criminal-defense attorney from the
northern city of Padua, who has served in both the Italian Senate and the lower house of Parliament. Ghedini has
continued to mount a grinding defense in the criminal cases, arguing in the Mills case that Berlusconi cannot be present
in the Milan courtroom for the next several months because of time conflicts with his duties as Prime Minister. Ghedini
has also spearheaded an increasingly aggressive legal strategy that has included several libel suits against opposition
newspapers. He declared in September that if necessary, Berlusconi would testify in a suit against a journalist who
referred to rumors that the Prime Minister is impotent. Last week, Berlusconi vowed to launch additional suits against
newspapers that printed unsubstantiated reports that a close adviser of his was involved in a 1993 bombing campaign '
by the Sicilian Mafia. (Read "An Offended Berlusconi Goes on the Offensive.")

Despite these many legal headaches, Berlusconi is embroiled in one other particularly thorny case that even he can't
blame on overzealous magistrates. Veronica Lario, Berlusconi's wife of more than 20 years, filed for divorce earlier this
year, which sparked an avalanche of accusations that he frequented a prostitute from Bari and an underage model from
Naples. The Milan daily Corriere della Sera reported last week that Lario has demanded 3.5 million euros ($5.2 million) in
monthly payments, and Berlusconi countered with an offer of 300,000 euros ($450,000). No matter how this and the
other cases shake out, there is little hope that Berlusconi can avoid a mountain of lawyers' fees and some grim
Saturdays that he'd rather devote to other business and pleasures.

Re: The Berlusconi assault
1. The physical attack on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is a major political event
in Italy and Europe. His assailant is a mentally disturbed man without a political agenda
who has been in and out of psychiatric care since he was 18 years old. Nonetheless, the
assault has significant repercussions. It has generated sympathy for Berlusconi as a
victim—he has been obviously injured, lost two teeth and a pint of blood, and doctors
will keep him in the hospital for perhaps a week for observation. The attack comes as
Berlusconi was beginning to lose political footing, having lost his legal immunity. One
court inquiry is turning up evidence of his links to the Mafia while another is examining
his role in the bribery case of British lawyer David Mills. Berlusconi' s government and
party have used the attack as a way to turn the sudden sympathy for him to his advantage,
claiming that his opponents have sown a climate of ""hate." Through demogogic appeals
they are attempting to discredit and rebuff the legal proceedings against him and
undermine the investigative press. (Berlusconi is suing La Repubblica, the large
independent newspaper in Rome that has been most aggressive in digging into his affairs
of all kinds.)
2. It would seem proper and decent for the President to call Berlusconi to express his
concern about his health and wish him a speedy recovery, if he hasn't done so already.
There are many reasons for Obama to do this, not least to condemn violence against a
democratically elected head of state. It would be awkward for the U.S. President not to
call a Western head of state of a NATO country who has been physically harmed.
Berlusconi, for his part, would certainly make such a call public. It would therefore also
be awkward if a call were used only as an element in his sympathy campaign against the
court proceedings.
3. If so, there is a larger message that should be communicated, perhaps by the President in
his conversation, but most importantly through a statement from the State Department,
also conveyed by the U.S. ambassador in Italy. The USG condemns any and all violence

as an assault on democracy. By the same measure, this incident involving an apparently
deranged individual should not be exploited to raise social tensions. Instead, it should
inspire reflection on the necessity of every citizen to adhere to the rule of law as well as
to respect freedom of speech and the press.

Berlusconi 'cut deal with Mafia', court told
Former hitman claims Italian PM gave 'benefits' to the Mob for political support
By Michael Day in Milan
Saturday, 5 December 2009
The Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, made a deal with the Sicilian Mafia in the early
1990s that put the country "in the hands" of the Mob, a court in Turin was told yesterday.
Gaspare Spatuzza, a jailed Mafia hitman turned witness, told a packed and heavily guarded
bunker courtroom that his Cosa Nostra Godfather boss had cut a deal with Mr Berlusconi in 1993
that provided unspecified "benefits" to the Mafia in exchange for political support. The media
tycoon entered politics a few months later and won his first term as Prime Minister in 1994.
Spatuzza said his boss, Giuseppe Graviano, who was jailed over Mafia bomb attacks in Rome,
Milan and Florence, had told him that the Mob had "got everything" with the help of Mr
Berlusconi, adding that Graviano called Mr Berlusconi "the man from Channel 5", in reference
to his TV network.
The damaging claims came at the appeal hearing of Marcello Dell'Utri, a key Berlusconi
associate and senator, who is challenging his nine-year jail sentence for links with the Mafia.
Spatuzza, in prison for several murders, testified: "Graviano told me the name of Berlusconi and
said that thanks to him and the man from our home town [an apparent reference to Dell' Utri] we
have the country in our hands."
Mr Berlusconi has denounced the claims of Spatuzza as "vile", and "unfounded and defamatory",
denying ever having links with the Mafia. The Prime Minister's spokesman said the testimony
yesterday was the Mafia's "completely logical" revenge against the Prime Minister for his
"determined" fight against organised crime.

Dell'Utri told the court that neither he nor Mr Berlusconi had Mafia connections. "It's in the
interest of the Mafia to force the collapse of the Berlusconi government because this government
has done the most in the fight against organised crime," he said. Mr Berlusconi, who recently lost
his legal immunity to prosecution, was said to have been furious this week, after the
parliamentary Speaker, Gianfranco Fini, the man who is supposed to be his closest ally, had said
that the Spatuzza evidence was "an atomic bomb".
Mr Fini was recorded by an unobserved microphone while talking privately at an official dinner.
Rumours of the conservative Prime Minister's links with the Mob have persisted since
investigators learnt that a Cosa Nostra hitman, Vittorio Mangano, worked as Mr Berlusconi's
"stable-master" at the media mogul's villa in Arcore outside Milan in the 1970s. Much
speculation has also centred on the origins of Mr Berlusconi's vast wealth.
Last week, the Prime Minister's broadcast group, Mediaset, and his holding company, Fininvest,
announced it intended to sue the left-wing newspaper La Repubblica over an article that said
Mediaset was "20 per cent owned by the Mafia".
La Stampa newspaper noted that the "dread combination of Mafia allegations and separation
from his wife are now his principal torments". Mr Berlusconi's estranged wife, Veronica Lario, is
said to be seeking a £3m-a-month divorce settlement, and a messy courtroom battle looms. Mr
Berlusconi also faces a retrial on the charge that he bribed the British lawyer David Mills to lie in
court.

After a Court Ruling, Berlusconi's Legal
Woes Resume
By Jeff Israely
The world has spent the past six months wondering how — and with whom — Silvio Berlusconi
spends his Saturday nights. But the combative, scandal-plagued Prime Minister of Italy would
prefer to talk about his mornings instead. "Do you know how I've been forced to spend my
Saturday mornings since I entered politics?" Berlusconi once declared to business leaders in
Rome. "With my lawyers."
Italy's self-proclaimed Defendant in Chief makes a point of lamenting all those weekends spoiled
by stacks of court dossiers as further proof that he is the victim of politically motivated
magistrates, whom he called during the same speech "the spreading cancer of our democracy."
(See Berlusconi's worst gaffes.)

To combat such perceived persecution, Berlusconi has tested the bounds of decorous democratic
conduct, including his allies' pushing a bill through Parliament last year that gave him and other
top Italian officeholders immunity from prosecution. But since the Constitutional Court
overturned that law in October, several criminal investigations into Berlusconi's business
dealings have been reopened, with other new charges rumored to be looming.
The potentially most damaging trial is set to resume Friday, Dec. 4, in Milan, with the 73-year-
old billionaire being accused of paying British attorney David Mills $600,000 in 1997 to
withhold incriminating evidence about his broadcasting empire Mediaset. Mills is appealing a
conviction in the same case; both men have denied any wrongdoing.
So, alas, Berlusconi is back to spending his downtime with a well-paid cadre of more than a
dozen avvocati, who have been successful so far in keeping their biggest client clear of criminal
convictions. Not that the lawyers have ever really gone away. Since the media baron first ran for
office 15 years ago, his legal advisers have doubled as political consiglieri, key members of
Parliament and even important Cabinet Ministers. Indeed, while some critics have spoken of
Berlusconi's reign as a kind of sultanate of showgirls or government by gaffe, others have
described it as a republic of attorneys. (See what Berlusconi's Obama "jokes" say about Italy.)
His longtime lawyer Cesare Previti served as Italian Defense Minister during Berlusconi's first
term in 1994 before being convicted of corruption himself (and losing twice on appeal). During
Berlusconi's second term (2001-06), Gaetano Pecorella, a former leftist, served as president of
Parliament's Justice Commission, where he was instrumental in shepherding through new laws
that helped shield Berlusconi from investigating magistrates.
Giovanni Sartori, a Columbia University professor of constitutional law, says the role
Berlusconi's personal lawyers have played in his legislative agenda is yet another gargantuan
conflict of interest to add to those related to his ownership of Italy's main private television
stations. But by now, Sartori says, Berlusconi's lawyers have perfected the art of exploiting
Italy's painfully slow justice system: many cases conclude without a final verdict because the
statute of limitations has been reached. "It is more a mania than a necessity," Sartori says of
Berlusconi's near obsession in battling magistrates. "He feels persecuted, and fighting the judges
is what makes him happy."
Berlusconi's current point man is Nicolo Ghedini, a somber-faced, lanky 49-year-old criminal-
defense attorney from the northern city of Padua, who has served in both the Italian Senate and
the lower house of Parliament. Ghedini has continued to mount a grinding defense in the
criminal cases, arguing in the Mills case that Berlusconi cannot be present in the Milan

Minister. Ghedini has also spearheaded an increasingly aggressive legal strategy that has
included several libel suits against opposition newspapers. He declared in September that if
necessary, Berlusconi would testify in a suit against a journalist who referred to rumors that the
Prime Minister is impotent. Last week, Berlusconi vowed to launch additional suits against

bombing campaign by the Sicilian Mafia. (Read "An Offended Berlusconi Goes on the

Gay groups grow impatient with Obama
By: Ben Smith and Jonathan Martin
June 4, 2009 04:32 AM EST
President Barack Obama's promises of change are falling short for one core Democratic
constituency: gays and lesbians, whose leaders say Obama's administration isn't keeping
up with the times.
Gay rights campaigners, most of them Democrats who supported Obama in November,
have begun to voice their public frustration with Obama's inaction, small jokes at their
community's expense and deafening silence on what they see as the signal civil rights
issue of this era.
His most important campaign promises repealing the Defense of Marriage Act and the
military ban on openly gay and lesbian service-members have not been fulfilled.
And the news, which emerged quietly earlier this year, that he'd supported same-sex
marriage back in 1996, then changed his mind, especially rankles. As mainstream
Democratic politicians such as Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) move to support same-sex
marriage, gay rights advocates say that the barrier-breaking president looks increasingly
odd for opposing what they see as full equality.
""Obama is out of step with his party, which is overwhelmingly in favor of marriage at this
stage," said David Mixner, a veteran gay rights activist who is among the organizers of a
march on Washington for same-sex marriage scheduled for this fall. "He's out of step with
the next generation."
Gay rights issues have been moving at breakneck speed, none faster than same-sex
marriage. Most public opinion polls now show more than 40 percent of Americans support
same-sex marriage, seen as a fringe issue just a few years earlier. Already, five New
England states and Iowa have same-sex marriage laws on the books.
"Politicians are finding out that their voters are moving faster than they anticipated," said
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who called Obama's place behind that curve

"surprising, because he is the next-generational candidate."
She noted that Obama could be concerned about alienating older voters in the Midwest
who would be turned off if he came out in support of same-sex marriage.

The White House has been reluctant to spend its political capital pushing Obama's
highest-profile pro-gay positions believing, White House allies say, that it could detract
from priorities like health care. And it may be even less likely to do next year, with
midterms approaching.
But officials have told restive gays and lesbians to give them until the end of this month to
show movement on a number of lower-profile issues they support, including restrictions on
visas for people with HIV. The Pentagon also has toned down public opposition to
reversing the gay ban, and the new secretary of the Army's job will be, in part, to smooth
the way for that move.
"The president remains fully committed to advancing LGBT rights. His positions on all of
these issues are well-established and well-known. His staff continues to work with
Congress on a variety of LGBT issues," said Jim Messina, the deputy White House chief
of staff who is the point man on gay and lesbian issues, citing White House efforts to
move hate crimes legislation through the Senate. "While we recognize that some in the
community are anxious, the president's commitment has not wavered."
Meanwhile, however, marriage equality has emerged as the movement's central issue, a
question that's seen as a simple matter of justice and fairness by a growing number of
Democrats.
"There's going to come a point where's he going have to deal with it," former Democratic
National Committee Chairman Howard Dean, who now supports same-sex marriage, said
of Obama. "I'm in favor of giving him a little more time. He's got an awful lot on his plate."
"But he is a politician like everybody else, and he's going to respond to pressure. And I
don't blame the LGBT community for trying to push," Dean said.
Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), who is openly gay and was a major Democratic donor before
being elected last year, said he was "very hopeful [Obama's] position will evolve."
But Polls warned, "If his position doesn't evolve, it could turn off some strong supporters."
Gay leaders in Washington, though, have been loath to publicly criticize the president.
They say they still view Obama as an ally and think private talks are more promising than
public pressure.
Still, it was especially frustrating for some left-leaning gay figures to see the otherwise
dreaded former Vice President Dick Cheney publicly express his support this week for
letting states allow gay marriage -- a position that puts him to theleft of Obama.

"I think that freedom means freedom for everyone," Cheney said in an appearance
Monday at the National Press Club.
Obama also has been criticized for a joke at the expense of same-sex marriage. After the
White House Correspondents Association dinner, columnist Dan Savage fumed that
Obama's only reference since being sworn in to the high-profile drive toward same-sex
marriage in Iowa had been a joke about going to the state with longtime friend and adviser
David Axelrod to "make it official."
"The best he can do — all he's willing to do — is toss off an Adam Sandler-level joke,"
Savage wrote.
Another Obama ally, writer Andrew Sullivan, recently referred to Obama's stance on gays
as "the fierce urgency of whenever."
And on the front line, in the states, gay rights advocates are also growing increasingly
impatient with Washington.
"His position has been causing some problems for those of us working in the states, those
who are against it are using him for cover," said Alan Van CapeIle, the executive director
of New York's Empire State Pride Agenda, who called on Obama to fulfill another
neglected campaign promise and back the full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act,
which blocks the federal government from extending benefits to married same-sex
couples.
Gay activists cringed recently when reminded by Donald Trump, of all people, that Miss
California Carrie Prejean shared the same position on gay marriage as the progressive
president.
"I'm still optimistic that the president is going to be good on his word," said Aubrey Sarvis,
the executive director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Networks, which opposes
the military ban.
"No one believes that [anti-gay federal policies] will be miraculously changed overnight,"
said Human Rights Campaign president Joe Solmonese, who added nevertheless that his
group is "frustrated at the pace of progress."
Behind the scenes, patience is wearing thin.
"People are far angrier than they're saying publicly, because they don't want to jeopardize
[White House] relationships with the groups," said John Aravosis, an openly gay blogger
who speaks to gay leaders. "But everyone is feeling like we've entered a danger zone
where the administration is backing away from us fast, and I can tell you that the
professional gay crowd in Washington, D.C., to a person, feels a sense of impending
betrayal."
The most heated battle is in California, where some of the same voters who
overwhelmingly elected Obama also passed a referendum barring same-sex marriage.
Proposition 8 has since energized the state's gay rights movement.

The Army linguist, Dan Choi, spoke at a rally across the street from the Beverly Hills Hilton
while Obama spoke inside at a high-dollar fundraiser late last month. The group
organizing the rally, the Courage Campaign, has gathered 140,000 signatures on a letter
to Obama asking him to rescind the ban.
Back at the fundraiser, Messina had the same message delivered in a somewhat more
intimate setting.
He was walking through the men's room at the Beverly Hilton when Mike Bonin, an activist
and former Obama campaign staffer who loves the president "the way Walt Whitman
loved Abe Lincoln," confronted him.
"I told him I was disappointed that [Obama] talked about justice and equal opportunity and
across the street stands Dan Choi, who's about to be booted out of the Army," he recalled
of the faucet-side chat.
Messina, Bonin said, responded that the White House hadn't forgotten, and complained
that the administration hasn't gotten enough credit for pushing to outlaw hate crimes
against gays and lesbians, but was ultimately "noncommittal." Bonin, who said he kept
Messina standing by the sinks for about ten minutes before letting him proceed to his
destination, said marriage advocates in California have been using Obama campaign
tools and strategies to push the White House.
"All the people who signed this petition for Choi, all the people who are outside across the
street at this rally, all the people who are coming to these [political training camps] are
Obama people who love and support our president," he said. "But he didn't stand up for
us, and until he does we're going to love him enough to be tough on him."
Correction: Hate crimes legislation has passed the House, but not the Senate; an earner
version of this story wrongly reported that it had become law.

Trip Report: Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul, Rome
Anne-Marie Slaughter
Shanghai: I was driven around the expo site and saw how far advanced the Chinese pavilion is, also the Canadian and
Brazilian pavilions that are facing and adjacent to us, and many spectacular European pavilions. In addition to the
overwhelming size and grandeur of the expo site as a whole — it will be like the New York World's Fair on steroids — what
struck me is that we must also hold up our end with the many visitors who will be coming from the Americas. The video
of the history of world expositions that plays in the Shanghai exposition building and will help open the expo itself is a
visual of rising American power — repeated expos in the 19th and 20th centuries in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, San
Francisco and other American cities. Expos are the soft power Olympics and hence a key part of smart power; we should
be willing to ask Congress for money and consider it extremely well spent in terms of building American power in the
world — and cheap at the price.
I also had several meals and meetings with members of what I am coming to think of as ""the American diaspora" —
talented and entrepreneurial Chinese-Americans and Chinese raised/educated in America who have come back to China
to live on the economic frontier — and who are spreading American values with them. They gave a very optimistic picture
of the Chinese economy.
Beijing: I had dinner with "new media figures"
In my official meetings on the S&ED we made real progress, getting the Chinese to agree to a closed meeting just with
the four principals and getting them to agree to consider a model of a joint statement that we will now provide; I made
very clear that a joint statement was critical to getting results. Later in the day we had a breakthrough with the Deputy
Minister of Commerce, who agreed to working level meetings and concrete "bottom-up" joint projects on development
assistance. His staff agreed to meet w/ the AID person at our embassy for the first time — as the embassy said, clearly
the Chinese have decided to move forward w/ us on multiple fronts.

The most striking thing to emerge from many conversations with officials and academics in Shanghai and Beijing was
how often the G-2 was raised — always in the context of "we don't believe in the G-2, but ..." One official said "we can

Rome: I met with my G-8 counterparts over dinner and then w/ G-8 policy planners plus representatives from South
Africa, Mexico, Brazil, and Egypt. The G-8 discussion yielded strong agreement that responsibility for outcomes should be
a key determinant of who gets to sit at the table, although the Germans and Italians want to expand the core
"convening" group to at least the G-8 plus the Heiligendamm 5. Canada, France, Britain and Japan very much liked my
tentatively floated idea that each G-8 member be able to decide as host which other countries to invite as full members,
depending on the problem chosen as the focus of the agenda. Strikingly, did not even bother to send a Rome- B1
based representative to the talks the next day, underlining my point that some of these countries really are not ready 1.4(D)
for regular responsibility for global issues. The representative, a truly impressive director general in their

countries were not represented. In the substantive discussion of Af-Pak and central Asia, the mbassador to
Rome emphasized that the Rio Group was taking a political position on Af-Pak as a sign of increasing hemispheric
engagement with the outside world.

Utah Governor to Become Ambassador to China
By Jeff Zeleny
Updated President Obama on Saturday selected one of the nation's leading Republican governors to serve as
the ambassador to China, nominating Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman for the diplomatic post that Mr. Obama called
""as important as any in the world."
"We will launch a new era of partnership between our two nations that will advance our shared dreams of
opportunity and security in America, in Asia and around the world," Mr. Obama said. "I can think of no more
important assignment than creating the kinds of bridges between our two countries that will determine the well
being not just of Americans and Chinese, but also the future of the world."
In a morning announcement at the White House, Mr. Huntsman stood at the president's side in the Diplomatic
Room and accepted the position that he said came as a surprise. As a co-chairman of Senator John McCain's
presidential campaign last year, Mr. Huntsman said he did not expect to be "called into action by the person
who beat us."
Mr. Huntsman, 49, learned to speak Mandarin Chinese from his days as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan. He
has worked in two Bush administrations, serving as the ambassador to Singapore in the final year of George
H.W. Bush's term and as a deputy United States trade ambassador for George W. Bush.
For Mr. Obama, whose advisers already have their eyes set on his re-election in 2012, the selection of Mr.
Huntsman is something of a political coup. He has emerged as one of the nation's most visible Republican
governors and was expected to at least consider seeking his party's presidential nomination to run against Mr.
Obama.
"In the breadth of issues at stake, this ambassadorship is as important as any in the world," Mr. Obama said. "I
believe there is much to be gained from a closer working relationship with China, but improved relationships
will require candor on issues in which we don't always agree."
As the Republican Party forges through a period of reinvention, Mr. Huntsman has been a leading voice for the
direction of the party. He has been a political moderate on issues like immigration, gay rights and the
environment, even though he represented one of the most conservative states in the country.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762241 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762241 Date: 06/30/2015
It was far from certain whether Mr. Huntsman would have actually sought the Republican presidential
nomination — his centrist views could have created a challenge in early-voting states — but if he is confirmed by
the Senate for the ambassadorship to China, he is part of the Obama team at a time when China is of critical
importance. And he is out of the mix in the 2012 presidential race.
"When the president of the United States asks you to step up and serve in a capacity like this, that to me is the
end of the conversation and the beginning of the obligation to rise to the challenge," said Mr. Huntsman, who
was joined by his wife Mary Kaye, and the couple's seven children, one of whom was adopted from China.
The courtship of Mr. Huntsman was overseen by the White House Chief of Staff, Ralun Emanuel, who met with
him last Saturday when the governor was in town for the White House Correspondent's dinner. Mr. Obama also
spoke to Mr. Huntsman, aides said, and was impressed by his experience and views on China.
"Governor Huntsman has respect for China's proud traditions," Mr. Obama said Saturday. "He understands
what it will take to make America more competitive in the 21st century and will be an unstinting advocate for
America's interests and ideals."
The nomination of Mr. Huntsman is the latest in a series of high-level Republican appointments in the Obama
administration. The president selected two Republicans to serve in his Cabinet, but aides said he was frustrated
when a third choice, Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, withdrew his nomination as
Commerce Secretary.
Mr. Huntsman, who was elected to his second term of governor last year, intends to step down if he is
confirmed by the Senate.
"I hope the good people of Utah will forgive me and understand how proud they should be of their governor for
his willingness to serve," Mr. Obama said. "He always puts country ahead of himself. That's what Jon has
always done."

Thanks, Hillary. I'm attaching the CV of and have also sent it to Jake. I'd have loved to attend the B6
India lunch, but I've got a long-standing working lunch with the ""Managing Global Insecurity" project at Brookings that
Carlos Pascual set up and has been leading. Tom Pickering, Tim Wirth, Chet Crocker, Esther Brimmer, and various other
such will be there, and I can't pull out (my office had passed this word to yours). I'm so pleased you're going to India. It
was your trip to the region, with Chelsea, in 95 that established the momentum for Bill's. I'll always remember you talk
(with slide show) at State after you returned. I'll send you tomorrow my book "Engaging India" now thatyou're re-
engaging them. Hard work ahead of on non-pro, as you know. Hope to see you before long. I'm taking to Italy B6

REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA
AND PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI OF ITALY
IN PRESS AVAILABILITY
Oval Office
5:48 P.M. EDT
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good evening, everybody. Buona sera. I want to
welcome Prime Minister Berlusconi here. He has proved to be a great
friend of the United States. And he and I got to know each other at the
G20 summit. We are now in the process of planning the G8 summit that
Italy will be hosting. We emphasized the strong, historic ties between
the United States and Italy. Our bilateral relationship has been marked
by cooperation across the board. And I am extremely grateful for his
friendship.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762382 Date: 06/30/2015
Just a couple of things that we specifically discussed. First of
all, I thanked the Prime Minister for his support of our policy of closing
Guantanamo. This is not just talk. Italy has agreed to accept three
specific detainees, and has also been part of the leadership in Europe
that today announced a framework in which European nations can accept
detainees. And that was something that I was very appreciative of. It
will give us an opportunity to create a lasting and durable international
legal framework for dealing with terrorism that I think is very important
on both sides of the Atlantic.
We discussed Afghanistan and Pakistan, where Italy has been a
critical part of the coalition that is trying to assist Afghanistan in
stabilizing itself and ensuring that it's not a safe haven for
terrorism. We had an extensive discussion about my interest in pursuing
nonproliferation as an important agenda for all people. And given that
I'll be visiting Russia before I visit Italy for the G8, Prime Minister
Berlusconi, who has strong relationships with the Russians, was able to
offer some insight in terms of how to approach reductions in nuclear
arsenals. And that hopefully is going to be a topic at the G8 summit, as
well.
And in addition to discussing the general situation in the world
economy, which obviously will be a central topic of the G8, we also
discussed specifically the issue of food security and how G8 nations can
assist people who are in most desperate poverty to ensure that they're not
slipping into hunger and further poverty. And that is going to be a major
topic of the G8 summit. And so I'm very appreciative of the leadership
that Prime Minister Berlusconi has shown on that front.
So overall I am very grateful to Prime Minister Berlusconi's
leadership, his consistent friendship towards the United States. We have
some of the strongest bilateral relations in the world. I am confident
that that will continue as long as both of us are occupying our positions.
And so thank you very much for taking the time to visit.
PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI: (As translated.) First of all, I would
like to thank President Obama for his welcome and for the possibility
offered us to provide our perspective, our opinions on many of the most
difficult and hardest issues at the international level. And we've
discussed, as he already briefed you, many of the issues and the topics,
and we went through in a detailed manner the three days of the G8
summit. We want this G8 to reach concrete solutions. And we want to
reach concrete solutions on many extremely important issues.
Clearly, the first issue is the world economy, the economic crisis
and how to get out of this crisis. And we also discussed the work that
our ministers of economy are carrying out right now to try and develop a
body of principles and to prevent similar situations from happening,
similar situations to the one we are experiencing right now.
130
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762382 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762382 Date: 06/30/2015
We both agreed on the fact that the G8 will certainly not be able to
produce this body of rules, but this is going to be just one of the steps
leading to that drafting of rules. There will be then the G20 summit in
Pittsburgh, which will work on it, but the hope is to finally reach a body
of rules which can be shared by everybody which -- which are not going to
affect or hinder the free expansion of the economy and trade.
And we discussed two important issues. One of them, which will be
discussed in L'Aquila as well, is food security, as President Obama has
already said. We hope that the countries there will make concrete efforts
and concrete proposals. The United States has already promised to
increase the aid to other countries and they're going to make in the next
three years huge amounts of money available. We try and will push the
other countries in the G8, trying to persuade them to do the same.
And another important issue is that of climate change. And another
important achievement we are aiming at is to reduce CO2 emissions --
something, however, which has to be contributed to by all countries and
not only a limited number of them. And since the Doha Round has reached a
stop, we hope that by inviting Lamy, who is the director of the WTO, to
attend the G8 summit, that we can try and give another push to the Doha
Round, hoping to achieve positive results.
Probably what I forgot to mention up to now is that the meeting in
L'Aquila is not going to be confined to the G8 countries. The next day,
the second day, will be G8-plus-6. The major economies of the world will
be there; India, China, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, and Egypt will
attend the second day of meetings. There will be the major economies
forum with the participation of South Korea, Indonesia, and Australia, and
then there is another meeting which will be attended also by the
Netherlands, Spain, and Denmark -- and we are going to have before all of
these meetings together.
The dinner will be attended also by the representatives of the main
international organizations. And the third day, we are going to have the
President of the African Union, the representatives of the main African
organizations, together with the representatives of some of the main
African countries. We are going to discuss the development of this
continent and the issue of hunger in that area.
And I can't but thank President Obama and express my warmest felt
appreciation to him for -- and this position is coming from a person
that's been long enough in international politics to chair for the third
time the G8 summit; the first one was in the 1994; the second one in 2001;
and now the third one -- I want to express my appreciation for his deep
knowledge and precision and accuracy with which he discusses all of the
issues.
And the positions that he expresses are not only innovative positions
looking at a different future, but they're always very concrete and
absolutely based on common sense. And it is extremely comforting and a

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762382 Date: 06/30/2015
pleasure to see that the destiny of the biggest democracy in the world is
in very good hands.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I hope my staff all caught
that. (Laughter.) Gibbs, write that down. (Laughter.)
Let me call on a couple people. Steve Thomma, McClatchy. There you
are.
Mr. President, on Iran, does the disputed election results
affect -- there's been violence in the street -- in any way change your
willingness to meet with Mr. Ahmadinejad without preconditions? And also,
do you have anything to say, any message to send to people who are on the
streets protesting, who believe their votes were stolen and who are being
attacked violently?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Obviously all of us have been watching the news
from Iran. And I want to start off by being very clear that it is up to
Iranians to make decisions about who Iran's leaders will be; that we
respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the
issue inside of Iran, which sometimes the United States can be a handy
political football -- or discussions with the United States.
Having said all that, I am deeply troubled by the violence that I've
been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process -- free
speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent -- all those are
universal values and need to be respected. And whenever I see violence
perpetrated on people who are peacefully dissenting, and whenever the
American people see that, I think they're, rightfully, troubled.
My understanding is, is that the Iranian government says that they
are going to look into irregularities that have taken place. We weren't
on the ground, we did not have observers there, we did not have
international observers on hand, so I can't state definitively one way or
another what happened with respect to the election. But what I can say is
that there appears to ba a sense on the part of people who were so hopeful
and so engaged and so committed to democracy who now feel betrayed. And I
think it's important that, moving forward, whatever investigations take
place are done in a way that is not resulting in bloodshed and is not
resulting in people being stifled in expressing their views.
Now, with respect to the United States and our interactions with
Iran, I've always believed that as odious as I consider some of President
Ahmadinejad's statements, as deep as the differences that exist between
the United States and Iran on a range of core issues, that the use of
tough, hard-headed diplomacy -- diplomacy with no illusions about Iran and
the nature of the differences between our two countries -- is critical
when it comes to pursuing a core set of our national security interests,
specifically, making sure that we are not seeing a nuclear arms race in
the Middle East triggered by Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon; making sure
that Iran is not exporting terrorist activity. Those are core interests
not just to the United States but I think to a peaceful world in general.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762382 Date: 06/30/2015
We will continue to pursue a tough, direct dialogue between our two
countries, and we'll see where it takes us. But even as we do so, I think
it would be wrong for me to be silent about what we've seen on the
television over the last few days. And what I would say to those people
who put so much hope and energy and optimism into the political process, I
would say to them that the world is watching and inspired by their
participation, regardless of what the ultimate outcome of the election
was. And they should know that the world is watching.
And particularly to the youth of Iran, I want them to know that we in
the United States do not want to make any decisions for the Iranians, but
we do believe that the Iranian people and their voices should be heard and
respected.
PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI: ANSA.
(As translated.) President Obama, after this meeting with Prime
Minister Berlusconi, what do you expect, in concrete terms, from the
relationship between United States and Italy? And to Prime Minister
Berlusconi, you had very strong relations with President George W.
Bush. Do you expect and do you hope to build the same type of relations
with President Obama, as well?
PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI: I took an oath of gratitude towards
United States, which gave me freedom and which gave my country dignity
after World War II. So I'm here to cooperate with the President of the
United States. I'm here to cooperate with President Obama, as I
cooperated with President Clinton and as I did with President Bush.
So if I can express a hope, I really hope we can build a direct and
friendly relationship with President Obama. I would be more than happy to
do so. And facts will tell.
But anyway, I think we had a good start.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Absolutely. We've had a very good start. What I
expect from the Prime Minister is an honest, frank sharing of views and a
recognition that the United States and Italy share common values, common
interests. Our economies have very strong commercial ties. And if we're
acting on those mutual interests, then I have no doubt that we'll continue
to see strong cooperation.
As I said before, Prime Minister Berlusconi's assistance on our
efforts to close Guantanamo is very important to us. I have to say, by
the way, that Bermuda has done us a great service, as well, on that front,
and I'm grateful to them.
When it comes to Afghanistan and Pakistan, we are part of the same
coalition that wants to make sure that the Afghan government is able and
strong to sustain development for the Afghan people, but also to make sure
that they're not serving as a safe haven for extremists.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762382 Date: 06/30/2015
When it comes to the world economy, I think all of us have an
interest in improving the kinds of financial regulations that will prevent
the kinds of crises that we saw happening most recently.
So, across the board, I think we have a host of common interests. In
addition to liking Prime Minister Berlusconi personally, our peoples like
each other and recognize that we have shared interests. And that, I
think, will make the path for continued cooperation that much easier.
(After translation.) I must say, my answers sound very elegant in
Italian. (Laughter.)
Steve Collinson.
Thank you, Mr. President. Of the conditions that Prime Minister
Netanyahu laid out yesterday for a Palestinian state, the basis for
negotiation, do you think they will likely prove a stumbling block, given
the broadly negative reaction from the Arab states and the Palestinians?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think it's important not to
immediately assess the situation based on commentary the day after a
speech. I think any time an Israeli Prime Minister makes a statement, the
immediate reaction tends to be negative on one side. If the other side is
making a statement, oftentimes the reaction is negative in Israel.
Overall, I thought that there was positive movement in the Prime
Minister's speech. He acknowledged the need for two states. There were a
lot of conditions, and obviously working through the conditions on
Israel's side for security, as well as the Palestinian side for
sovereignty and territorial integrity and the capacity to have a
functioning, prosperous state, that's exactly what negotiations are
supposed to be about. But what we're seeing is at least the possibility
that we can restart serious talks.
Now, I've been very clear that, from the United States' perspective,
Israel's security is non-negotiable. We will stand behind their
defense. I've also made very clear that both sides are going to have to
move in some politically difficult ways in order to achieve what is going
to be in the long-term interests of the Israelis and the Palestinians and
the international community.
On the Israeli side, that means a cessation of settlements. And
there is a tendency to try to parse exactly what this means, but I think
the parties on the ground understand that if you have a continuation of
settlements that, in past agreements, have been categorized as illegal,
that's going to be an impediment to progress. On the Palestinian side,
whether it's the Palestinian Authority or other groups like Hamas that
claim to speak for the Palestinians, a recognition of the Quartet
principles, ensuring that there's a recognition of Israel's right to
exist, making sure that past agreements are abided to, that there's an end
134

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762382 Date: 06/30/2015
to incitement against Israel and an end to violence against Israel. Those
are necessary pillars of any serious agreement that's to be reached.
And those pillars have to be supported by the Arab states, because
Israel's security concerns extend beyond simply the Palestinian
Territories; they extend to concerns that they have in a whole host of
neighbors where there's perceived and often real hostility towards
Israel's security. So I'm glad that Prime Minister Netanyahu made the
speech. The United States will continue to try to be as honest as
possible to all sides in this dispute to indicate the degree to which it's
in everybody's interests to move in a new direction. And I think it can
be accomplished, but it's going to require a lot of work and a partnership
with key countries like Italy in order to help the parties come together
and recognize their own interests.
You discussed during the meeting the crisis, the economic
crisis, you're going to discuss at the G8. The package of measures you
are discussing right now, can this be a kind of basis for the next
meetings -- G8 and G20?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, our respective finance ministers, not just
Italy's and the United States', but all the G8 members', have been meeting
diligently. They've put forward a framework that will be discussed and
hopefully ratified at the G8. That will provide a broad set of
principles.
Now, the United States is putting forward some very specific
regulatory reforms that are going to make sure that we don't find
ourselves in this position again, that improves oversight, ensures that
banks aren't taking risks with highly leveraged money that can result in
systemic collapse, that consumers and investors are protected more
effectively.
So we're going to have a lot of work to do. It's going to be a big,
complex piece of legislation. Different countries are going to have
different needs. Prime Minister Berlusconi was indicating to me that the
banking system in Italy has not been under the same kinds of pressures as
the banking system in the United States and some other European countries.
But I think the general principle -- that we're going to have
improved oversight, better practices, and that there's some coordination
and information-sharing between countries on issues like tax havens, for
example, so that you don't have global capital avoiding more stringent
rules by going to countries with weaker rules -- I think that's going to
be something that all G8 members affirm, and we very much appreciate Prime
Minister Berlusconi's leadership on this issue.
PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI: I would like to add to this that our
ministers of finance have been working on all of these issues and
packages. In particular they paid attention, for instance, to corporate
governments and rules for transparency and a regulation of the financial
sectors, accounting rules, and as President Obama has also mentioned,
135

also, the issue of tax havens, to try and prevent those situations from
happening again. And the idea is to work out a set of rules and
regulations which can prevent situations and conditions like the ones
we've experienced which have led -- from happening, experience that is to
-- which led first to the financial crisis and then to the economic crisis
that we are experiencing right now.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you. Grazie.

Ghana, but not forgotten
By: Josh Gerstein
July 4, 2009 07:38 PM EST
It might seem like a moment just too good for the White House to pass up — America's first
black president, on his first trip to sub-Saharan Africa, looking out over a sea of jubilant
faces, delivering a message of friendship and hope.
Yet President Barack Obama, who would command a monumental audience nearly
anywhere he spoke on the continent where he traces his ancestry, is not scheduled to
deliver a speech to the general public when he visits Ghana next week.
The White House said it preferred a smaller event at Ghana's parliament to herald the
nation's democratic traditions. But some suspect the reason has its roots in an event that
holds a storied place in White House lore — President Bill Clinton's 1998 speech to a
massive crowd in the sweltering heat of Accra, Ghana, where Obama will visit as well.
For Clinton, the first stop on a 12-day, six-country African journey was a chance to bask in
the adulation far from Washington, then consumed with the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
Clinton now regularly pegs the size of the crowd that day at 1 million, though years ago he
described it simply as more than 500,000.
Whatever the number, the overheated, overcrowded, overwhelming event left some in
Clinton's party worried that he'd been shot, and a doctor concerned that he could contract
HIV from frantic interaction with the crowd. And it took a threatening turn at the end, as a
red-faced, shouting Clinton implored the crowd, ""Get back! Back off!" as it threatened to
crush a woman near the front of the stage.
"The crowd was so large that it began surging towards the stage. Suddenly, a woman in
the front of the crowd began to get trampled," recalled Sandy Berger, Clinton's national
security adviser at the time. "Clinton jumped up and put his arm down over the side and
grabbed her. The Secret Service thought he'd been shot and freaked out."
A7

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762645 Date: 06/30/2015
"He saved her life," Berger said. "It was a kind of tumultuous scene."
Clinton's White House physician Dr. Connie Mariano said she started out that day worried
about the heat, but wound up concerned about HIV.
"It was steamy, and hot, and miserable," Mariano recalled. "[Ghana's president General
Jerry] Rawlings put a ceremonial robe over [Clinton's] dark business suit and I thought,
'Oh my God, he's going to pass out," she said.
Mariano said the feverish crowd and the scuffle over people being crushed at the front left
the president nicked up.
"He got scratches. His hands were cut because people's nails were scratching him
because they wanted to hold him," she said. "Realize how many HIV-positive people there
were there. ... It was an extremely frightening experience."
As the crowd surged forward, police wielding rubber truncheons slammed them down on
the hands of people holding onto the barricades. The front-line people would jump back,
only to be pushed forward, grab the barricades, and have their hands whacked again.
Reporters offering bottled water to parched Ghanaians nearly triggered a stampede.
"I just remember the mass of flesh. There was like a gazillion people, more than I had ever
seen in my life," said Ann Scales, who covered the event for The Boston Globe.
Clinton's speechwriter that day, Ted Widmer, recalled a feeling of sensory overload.
"It was surreal in many ways — just one sensation after the next," he said. "Sweat was
pouring out of every pore in my body. ... I was seeing these people do a lion dance with
deafening drums. ... I've been at plenty of unmemorable political speeches. This one was
carnival-esque and fun."
During the presidential primary campaign last year, Clinton often invoked the memory of
his Accra speech as an example of when he was at his rhetorical peak. "Back when I was
in politics, I was a reasonably good speaker," Clinton told college students in Austin,
Texas last February. "I once spoke to a million people in Ghana."
Estimates of how many people were actually on hand that day vary widely. In Clinton's
book, "My Life," he says "more than half a million people." White House officials speaking
to reporters that day said security aides to Rawlings had also estimated the crowd at more
than 500,000. However, The Associated Press reported that Ghanaian officials put it at
more than 1 million. The New York Times used the half-million estimate, but also reported
that Independence Square, where Clinton spoke, "has a capacity of more than 200,000."
Whatever the true number, Obama isn't trying to top it. He'll address Ghana's parliament,
meet the country's president, and tour a slave fort on Ghana's coast on the final stop of
week-long trip that also takes him to Russia to meet the country's leaders and Italy for a
G-8 summit and to see Pope Benedict XVI.
A senior White House official, speaking on background, said staging Obama's major
speech at the parliament "primarily reflects and emphasizes the importance of different

institutions in the political life of Ghana," the official said.
In a briefing for reporters this week, the National Security Council's director for African
Affairs, Michelle Gavin, indicated Obama's main interaction with ordinary people during his
less-than-24-hour visit will come at the Accra airport during "a departure ceremony that
will allow more Ghanaians an opportunity to participate in the visit."
In addition to the challenges inherent in controlling a friendly crowd, another possible
factor weighing against a major outdoor speech by Obama is the terrorist threat posed by
at Qaeda. The bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania came in August
1998, about five months after Clinton spoke to the throngs in Ghana. Since September 11,
2001, there have also been reports of al Qaeda activity in the West African countries
Liberia and Sierra Leone.
"It's another world," Mariano said. "We were pre-9/11 with Clinton. After 9/11, everything
changed."
Even without a formal public event, thousands of Ghanaians are sure to flock into the
streets in the hopes of getting a glimpse of Obama. There should be no shortage of
pictures of excited Africans cheering the U.S. president's visit.
When President George W. Bush went to Ghana in February 2008, he avoided venues
that might draw a large crowd. There was no grand speech. Bush met with Peace Corps
volunteers at the U.S. ambassador's residence, talked to development groups at a foreign
trade center, took in a one-inning tee-ball game, and attended a State Dinner at Osu
Castle, which was then the seat of government.
One highlight of Bush's visit was the performance of the U.S. national anthem by
American Idol winner Jordin Sparks, who works against malaria.
Of course, in a sense Obama may already have broken whatever record Clinton set in
Accra 11 years ago. When Obama was sworn in in January, Washington, D.C. officials
estimated the crowd at 1.8 million. Other estimates ranged from 800,000 to 3 million. Of
course, no one was in danger of heatstroke. Frostbite was more like it.
In 2008, during the presidential campaign, Obama spoke in Germany to a crowd Berlin
police estimated at more than 200,000.
The purported million-strong turnout for Clinton's speech is all the more impressive given
Ghana's size. The country's population back in 1998 was estimated at 18.5 million, while
about 2 million people lived in the capital.
Berger said Ghanaians still remember the event fondly. "I was in Ghana two weeks ago
and people still talk about it," he said. "Everybody I talked to said they were there."
Scales said keeping Obama out of a mass-crowd situation is "probably a very smart
decision."
"President Clinton was considered by some the first black president," she said. "Just
imagine what kind of crowd America's real first black president could draw."

Secretary Clinton,
Thank you! Will update you when I hear from her, and if there is anything else I should do, let me know. All
best, Jackie
ps Saw that Foreign Minister Yeo was on your schedule today. Fyi, he is one of my favorite Singaporeans
because of this 2007 speech on China, which he posted to his blog (!):
April 12, 2007
Foreign Minister George Yeo's speech at a dinner organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy on 5
February 2007, which he gave off-the-cuff.
Thank you Kishore for your kind words. Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen. I was in India two weeks ago, had
a good trip, spent nine days there. While in Calcutta after calling on the Chief Minister, I had a bit of time to
look around so I attended a mass at Mother Theresa's house. Very interesting gathering; there was a Singapore
nun there, she had been there for over ten years; Sister Maria Tony. I wondered why someone from Singapore
would want to dedicate her life to picking up the dead and the dying in the back alleys of Calcutta and living
that life. There were many nuns there who were in their ninth year. They take their first vow in the fifth year,
renewable every year. In the tenth year they have to decide - final vows for eternity. So if you are not sure,
please, there's a way out; if you are sure, then you're in the room. So the priest gave a very tough sermon and
while he was talking, I could hear the din of traffic noise outside, in the streets of Calcutta. Then suddenly, I
heard the call of the muezzin. Now this is a Hindu city. I told myself, I thought wow, what diversity in this
country, India, and its ability to internalise this diversity and to find it unremarkable that the tiny woman from
Albania should come into their midst, become one of them and then when she was beatified, was celebrated as
an Indian, on the way to canonization.
China and India in that comparison- China is not India. China has a very different sense of itself; its deep
internal construction is very different. Superficially there are similarities, as there is between China and the US
and China and Europe. But if you look into it's deep construction, it is very different. When we talk about
China's future and China in the 21st century, how China will behave in a world community, China's attitudes
towards democracy, towards law, towards social justice. It is important first to look into this deep construction
because that is their nature. Naturally we should not be deterministic, there is nothing inevitable in human
history, but when we understand its nature, it becomes easier to anticipate its moves and you'll be less suprised
by its actions.
A few years ago, the Chinese government embarked on a major project which is its dynastic duty- to write the
history of the Qing dynasty, the Manchus, from 1368 to 1644. Ever since the Han dynasty, roughly
contemporaneous with the Roman Empire, they developed a historiographic tradition of each dynasty writing
the history of the previous period. So Sima Qian of the Later Han wrote of the earlier Han and the entire period
before that; then later on they wrote about the Later Han, Jin wrote up the Three Kingdoms; Ming wrote up the
Yuan: The Yuan, which was Mongol in its origins wrote up the Sung. Sung wrote up the Tang dynasty which
was the Classical Period. The last dynasty, the Qing, collapsed in the Republican Revolution of 1911; this is
now 2007. I think in 2003, they embarked on this project, 'The Official History of the Qing dynasty'. When the
former Vice Premier Li Lanqing was in Singapore recently, I asked him about it. He said ""we told the scholars
not to rush this project". I asked him how long it would take to write this history. He said it would take many
years, easily 10 years. I said, "have you collected the material?" He said yes. I asked, "external sources?" He
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762814 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762814 Date: 06/30/2015
said yes, external sources too. All the countries, the Vatican, European countries, the whole lot; all assembled -
24 official histories, this would be the 26th. And Li's instruction to them was not to be too quick to draw
conclusions!
Now Mao Tze Tung was a revolutionary, he was a great revolutionary. He overturned everything before but he
knew his history, he read the 24 histories, and not only did he read them, he annotated them. But he wrote with
a terrible, illegible scrawl, so scholars had to decipher those scrawls. Then they wrote commentaries on his
commentaries and now it's all published. It is very difficult for the Chinese to depart from their own history
because it's the same great plains, the same mountains more or less, the same neighbours more or less and they
have seen the same patterns recur. So a long time ago during the Ming dynasty they wrote up the romantic
period of the Three Kingdoms. The first line said: "Below heaven, great movements, great currents, long
disunity leads to unity and long unity leads to disunity." So they accept as a part of their own deep nature that
there are cycles in their civilisation; that they have ups and downs. In recent years, when you visit them, you
could sense them feeling their own re-emergence, it's a bit scary. In the initial years, they were lacking in
confidence, they asked many questions, but now they know that there is an organic vitality. It is like an
adolescent who watches his own development, and conscious of it. I say scary because for those of us who live
on the periphery of that empire, what happens there will radiate its influence on us and eventually, to a greater
or lesser degree envelope us.
How do we see China? I think to begin with, it's important not to try and, from an intellectual viewpoint,
transpose our own experiences on to China, because I believe it will develop according to its own logic,
according to its own DNA. It is growing now, it will continue to grow, it will develop its own contradictions
and one day those contradictions, many years from now, will lead to its own decline. So they say at the
beginning of a dynasty the taxes are light but the treasury is full, and at the end of a dynasty, the taxes are
crushing but the treasury is empty. The important thing to realise about China is that some things are deeply
resistant to change. Take Confucius. Every time they had to overturn a dynasty, they had to overturn Confucius,
because Confucius justified the status quo. So throughout the 19th century, whether it was the Taiping
Revolution, the Communist movement or Sun Yat Sen; they spent their lives debunking Confucius. It reached
its final moment when they criticised Zhou Enlai together with Confucius- no- Lin Biao together with
Confucius. That was the last paroxysm. Today, Hu Jingtao said [in Mandarin He Xie She Hui ], "harmonious
society". Suddenly you hear the resonance of Confucius coming back. And everywhere in the world on the
pattern of Alliance Francaise, the Goethe Institute, the USIA, they establish Confucius Institutes and the
learning of the Confucianist classics are coming back with remarkable force in China, not yet in the state
curriculum but just parents wanting to teach their children the Confucianist ditties. Now why is this important?
From Mao to Deng to Jiang Zemin, at every stage, they re-interpreted Marx. They are comfortable with the
young Marx, the idea of the superstructure on the economic base, the idea that politics is concentrated
economics- that they like. But the class struggle, they downplay. They talk about the Three Represents, the
progressive forces, the progressive elements, they nurture those. Now Hu Jingtao says "harmonious society",
"peaceful re-emergence". This mindset has a certain attitude towards law, has a certain attitude towards religion,
towards democracy and towards foreign policy and I would like, to deal with each in turn.
Joseph Needham many years ago, I think in the 60's, the man who wrote The Science and Civilisation of China,
that great encyclopedic work; he said its not that the Chinese have no legal tradition. In fact, by his estimation,
the Chinese had a greater corpus of legal codification than the West. A greater corpus of legal codification than
the West! Surprise, surprise. But the idea that the Emperor is below the law, that is completely alien to their
thinking. Where did that idea come from? Well in the West, you may trace it back to Hammurabi, you may
trace it back to Moses, to Greece, to Rome. But if you trace the evolution of that DNA, it goes back, way back,
into its early beginnings. The Chinese had a very different evolutionary starting point. It was not in law, it was
in an idea they call '1i' which is proper conduct among human beings. They believe, deep in their instincts, that
law is only a means towards justice, and that when the outcome of law is perverse, then that law must be
overridden, because justice, proper conduct, the proper relationship among human beings must take
precedence. And to suddenly say that all that had happened in the previous dynasties, all that the earlier
histories have summarised, are all wrong and that they should instead adopt something with its origins in
Western Europe, which had as its crowning moment the crowning of Charlemagne by the Pope in the year 800;

to them, what are you talking about? For the Chinese, laws are more like regulations, means towards a larger
end. Their attitude towards democracy follows a parallel pattern.
Democracy is not an end in itself, democracy is a means and they are quite happy to consider democracy as a
useful means towards government and that at appropriate places and appropriate levels, democracy is good. So
at the village and the township level they have democracy, it is a universal franchise. They approve a slate of
candidates, and they have fierce elections, fierce campaigning, and those who are incompetent or arrogant or
despotic, they get chucked out. But once you reach the level of the cities and the provinces, they say no. No
direct democracy. Why not? Because they do not believe, with their view of the universe, that that is the way to
produce good government. Any more than the Catholic Church believes that the way to elect the Pope is
through universal franchise. That the parishioners should decide who should be the parish priest. The Parish
Council, maybe, that's ok. But the parish priest? Bishops? Universal franchise? That's against God's laws. They
have that kind of instinct embedded in them, it is not Communist, it is just Chinese. And they know that too
much democracy, invariably leads to 'localitis'; of favouritism towards friends, relatives, people who are from
the same villages whom we have a relationship with.
We have the same problem in Singapore, in fact this problem exists throughout East Asia. Till today, apart from
Singapore, among Chinese communities and among many East Asian communities, the idea that ultimate
control of the business should go outside the family is unpersuasive. You talk to Li Ka-shing, you talk to Robert
Kwok, you talk to Lim Soe Liong, you talk to any of them; they will go back to the family. Why? Because they
believe that in the end, what matters at the deepest level, is trust. And the family guarantees you that trust.
This is also the Indian wisdom. So you have the Marwaris controlling the economy of Calcutta, you have the
Parsees, you have Sindhis, of which Kishore is a member, you have the Chettiars. They operate on the basis of
deep trust and at a completely different level from that of contract law. And because they distrust local
affiliations, in two dynasties, Ming and Qing, no senior official could serve within 400 miles of where he was
born. No local official to serve within 400 miles, so in other words, in Singapore, no Singaporean can govern
Singapore. They go beyond that, today there's almost no province in China where the provincial leader is from
that province. Now you consider this, you transpose this onto Europe, it's as if routinely, the President of France
is not French. And if you are a German, you are disqualified as a Chancellor of the Republic. And an Italian
cannot be trusted to serve in Rome. Ancient wisdom! What is remarkable is this is accepted as legitimate. If you
are Cantonese and you have a Northener squatting over you, you do not consider it perverse or an abomination.
This is part of life and in fact, you are more likely to have impartial governor than if a local boy were to be
there, because he is more likely to favour those who are related to him or those who are his friends.
So when you talk democracy to the Chinese, it is against this cultural backdrop. So what applied to the Qing
dynasty, the Ming dynasty, they have taken a step further recently in China. They introduced even more rules,
governing the circumstances under which you are disqualified from serving in the area near where you were
born. You can't stay in a ministry for too long, you can't stay in a department for too long beacuse if you stay
too long, you develop affiliations and those affiliations will result in sidedoors and guanxi and corruption. Of
course, many of these rules will still be breached, and there will be scandals from time to time and they will act
on those scandals. For as long as the central leadership is pristine, the system can be maintained. But one day
they will become corrupt, as in so many previous dynasties, and a downward spiral begins. And it is very
difficult in that situation to reverse it.
So I mentioned at the table that for India, it's not a country that can sustain a revolution, because its deep
structure would not allow for it. I think China is a country which can only be renewed through periodic
revolutions. Kishore asked me when- I said well maybe in 200 years time because these are long cycles and
they expect as a matter of course that the history of the People's Republic would not be written by the People's
Republic. It will be written by the next dynasty. Except that right now they say we shouldn't call it a dynasty,
we are now democrats, we are a republic, there is no Emperor...Well, whatever term you call it, it will be done
much later.
Let me now talk about their attitude towards religion. Being a Roman Catholic I follow quite closely the ups
and downs in their relationship with the Vatican and I find it quite fascinating. The Jesuits, when they went to
China in the Ming dynasty, hoped that they could convert the Emperor, and all of China would become Catholic
and a great mission would have been achieved. They never succeeded. Some of the brightest minds from
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762814 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762814 Date: 06/30/2015
Europe went there. Matteo Ricci, he corrected the Chinese calendar, he repaired the clocks in the palace, he saw
the throne, but he never got to meet the Emperor and he died in China. And his tomb, it's in the compound of
the Beijing Party School today. And the church which he founded is still there today. 'Li Matou', that's what he
called himself, he applied for permission to be buried in China and he was given that permission. Then when
the Manchus swept southwards, in 1644, the missionaries thought now they had a chance, "the Manchus will be
a bit more accomodating towards us, we will yet Christianise China". So if you read the despatches of the
missionaries during that period, the Tartar Wars they described it, they were full of hope. But not a chance.
They appealed to the Second Emperor, Kangxi.
"Can we send more missionaries?" "No problem". "Can we have them all report to a papal legate in Beijing"
"No such thing". The Emperor imposed one condition: "you can send as many priests as you want to China but
they must die in China, they cannot leave after that". You see, instinctively, the Chinese, when they see the
Catholic Church, they see someone like themselves, someone whose claim to its members is total. And for
whom that loyalty is a jealous one.
Mind you they do not try to control everything; they just control the big things, dogma, doctrine. After that you
are left on your own and you are financially independent, but on the big issue of who appoints ministers and
provincial secretaries, it's the same as the Pope appointing Bishops and Bishops ordaining Priests and governing
this vast empire, whether we're talking about the Chinese empire or the Catholic empire. They have about the
same number of members in the world which is why their interaction is a complex and difficult one. And over
the appointment of Bishops, both seek ultimate authority. In the end they have got to find a way to resolve it. I
can anticipate the Vatican's argument that "we are not of this realm, we are of the other realm, so please we are
not in conflict". As for the Chinese leaders, their attitude towards religion from the earliest days is to keep
religion at arm's length. Those who govern the empire, they are areligious, they can have private religions, but
in matters of their public conduct, they are Confucianist. In public, you are not a Catholic, you are not a
Muslim, you are not a Buddhist. When the Jesuits went to China, they were very impressed by this - that it was
possible to create a moral order based not on religion but on ethics. So impressed, that they wrote about it, and
influenced people like Voltaire and the other Encyclopedists. It helped inspire the Frence revolution- that you
could get rid of the Church, and still maintain a moral order in society.
I've talked about China and law, China and democracy, China and religion, now let me talk about China and
foreign policy which is perhaps your greatest interest; about which I can only talk about generally because you
are the experts in this field. I think it's very difficult for the Chinese to break from their old mindset that they are
[Zhong Guo], the Middle Kingdom, they are at the center of the Universe, then there are the other 'chopsticks
peoples' who are semi-Sinic. I think they consider Singapore to be semi-Sinic. Then there are those who are
beyond that realm, who are what the Greeks would have called Barbarians. The Mongols, the Manchus, the
Europeans, the Americans, the Indians and so on.
Now all that jargon of course is not in use today. They are very civilised, they will welcome you with great
hospitality - lavish dinners, very courteous words, offering you the best of everything in the house. It reminded
me of the way my mother used to teach us at home, we were a big family and the stranger has got to be treated
well, the visitor has to be treated well, because you are afraid of the visitor. So you always treat visitors better
than your own family members because the visitor is capricious, he can harm you so make sure you fit him in.
Those who are within your authority, you can always maintain order anyway. This is the way, in their minds,
the universe is ordered. So I can understand why the Koreans, the Japanese, the Vietnamese, to some extent, the
Singaporeans, they feel uncomfortable about what they see as a repetition of a pattern they have seen many
times before in the past. Will the Chinese change this principle of foreign policy, I think they have, because,
never in their history have they met, have they existed in close contact with competing centers of power, with
the US, with Europe, India, and you are no longer separated by oceans which cannot be crossed, mountains
which cannot be crossed, now they are connected. So they are making adjustments.
It will be interesting to watch how they handle their Olympics; if the Olympics become an exercise of pure
Chinese nationalism, I think the international reaction against China will be very severe. But I think the Chinese
will be sophisticated. I expect they will organise cheer teams for the Americans, for the Japanese, so that there
is an appearance of courtesy and common humanity. They are very careful to ensure that their words fit
conditions today.
But let me say in their defence that many of these methods they use arise out of fear, not out of a desire to
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762814 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762814 Date: 06/30/2015
dominate. If you analyse the old tributary system, those who sent tributes got more than they gave in return. It
became a racket. So the Japanese merchants competed to get tokens from [Ryukyu] in order to be able to do the
China trade because it meant a lot of money. The Chinese are fearful of foreigners. They are fearful of the
Russians to the north, the Muslims to the West, the Indians across the Himalayas, but mostly the Americans
across the Pacific. Their strategy is to keep the temperature low, low profile, hide the shine of your armour, the
shine of your sword, just play the game and concentrate on economic development. Internally will they make
preparations? I have no doubt, because they have a deep fear. Is their intention to dominate, to conquer, the way
the European powers did in the past? I don't think so. I don't think there is a great desire to turn non-Chinese
into Chinese. Maybe Korea, maybe Vietnam, maybe Mongolia, who at various points in time were part of their
greater empire, they might consider worth civilising. But beyond that, Sinicising Indians, Russians? No, I don't
think they will want to do that. So as they now become stronger and more powerful, I believe that while their
old nature will re-assert itself, they will also be reacting to us. If they find the world a threatening place, they
will develop their own responses to those threats.
Quite early in the day, they wanted to neutralise Southeast Asia, Asean. It had never been an area which
threatened them, historically. So they didn't worry about Southeast Asia as a threat. But resources, sea lanes,
they go through Southeast Asia. And they made a dramatic move a few years ago. Zhu Rongji was here for the
ASEAN-China summit. He said, "free trade agreement". At that time when he announced it, the leaders of
ASEAN almost fell off their chairs. We thought of China an economic threat to us. Not as a partner. Took us
almost a year to digest the implications and to say yes, let's negotiate. Step by step. And all the time China was
assuring us that we would benefit more than they would benefit. When the Framework Agreement was signed
by Zhu Rongji in 2002 in Phonm Penh, he made two remarkable statements. He said if after 10 years, the
agreement benefits China more than it benefits Southeast Asia, let us renegotiate it. I can never imagine the
American USTR, or the European Trade Commissioner, talking like that. I mean in a contract, a deal is a deal,
it's settled for eternity. Then he said: "China does not seek for itself an exclusive position in Southeast Asia", so
he acknowledged that we were not just going to date one girl, we intended to be promiscuous from the
beginning. Towards Northeast Asia, I think it is very complicated, because there is so much history and legacy.
Towards Central Asia, towards Russia, they have deep fears. Towards America, it has become a relationship
bound together at so many points, a rupture would become more and more unthinkable. But it is going to be a
very difficult relationship, it will be the most important and most difficult relationship to manage in this
century. If it's badly managed there will be war, if it's properly managed there will be another generation of
peace and hundreds of millions of people in the world would be raised out of the depths of poverty. In this area,
you are the experts, but whenever I see China and watch its moves, I go back to its deep nature because it's not
easy for a country so vast, with such a sense of itself, to depart too much from its deep nature. Thank you.

Quick note to tell you the meeting ended today after lunch and it turned out to be a very positive event. To a person, the
heads of delegation were hugely complimentary. Good, very candid — even ""frank" as the diplomats say -- level of
engagement, a lot of positive feeling and trust built up, an eagerness for this group to continue engaging and — perhaps —
make some progress. Dan Reifsnyder, an OES DAS who's been here a long time, said it was best meeting of this kind he
has seen in 20 years.
Issues still damnably difficult, but a pretty palpable sense in the room that something good had happened. Hearty
congrats from the Chinese, UK, Japanese, Aussies, EU, Danes, Swedes, South Africans, etc. Mike Froman did an
excellent job as Chair (I was head of U.S. delegation), and Steve Chu and John Holdren did very useful presentations
yesterday. Heads of delegation met with President in Blue Room for a reception late yesterday afternoon, which went
over big. Mike and I met with President in Oval beforehand. Reception at Kennedy Center in evening for whole
delegations, plus people from Hill, NG0s, etc., yesterday. Sen. Kerry spoke.
We followed up with a long bilateral with China and then a private dinner with the UK. More bilats tomorrow. Next
meeting of the Forum May 25-26 in Paris.
Many thanks to HRC for kicking it off in style.

Also a lot of the higher ed in the developing world is church based and funded. The Methodists have started a large
university in Africa. There are other examples like the college in Lahore Lugar mentioned to me. We should have a rep of
this segment of higher ed operating in other countries.
And .

who Bill likes a lot. It's a for-profit model that should be represented.

To all -- the message below is from Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. Maura Connelly and Ihad dinner with him
last night, and by the headline put on Matthew Lee's AP piece on Judeh's visit. (The headline said that

Sounds good. We could do either dinner or lunch but would have to do next week if we hope it will influence/hype

I've got to have Lona get invites out today - the list is 18 after speaking with the Secretary on theory we will have yield of
12 - 14.
Before I have Lona invite anyone, I want to phase invites so our highest priorities have chance to response first and need
to know how big is too big to work; I have targeted 12-14 outside guests - given an expectation of 6-8 government folks.

Bigalke 'Karl
Preparing this to share with my Board; welcome your edits, additions, corrections. Thanks
Observations
1. There is a considerable change in Indonesian attitudes toward the United States. The latest Pew Global Polls
indicate a 73% approval level; the last time it was nearly this level was only in the wake of the generous help
provided after the Tsunami disaster. Higher education officials warmly welcomed our trip and, more importantly,
are eager to increase student flows to America and institutional partnerships between U.S. and Indonesian
universities. The Director General for Higher Education (DGHE) has been given a special budget to promote this,
seven leading schools have been given special budgets by DGHE to explore partnerships, and the Ministry will
support a delegation of leading Indonesian educators and Rectors to visit the U.S. sometime in late fall/early
winter.
2. The Delegation represented over 30 colleges and universities arrived only 9 days after the terrorist bombing of
two hotels in Jakarta, which meant our Indonesian hosts deeply appreciated the show of solidarity we made by
coming. During our visit, the White House announced that President Obama would come to Jakarta in
November. The U.S. Ambassador arranged for the entire Country Team to brief us on our first day; we saw him
and his senior staff three more times during the week for substantive meetings, and he attended the farewell
dinner given by the Minister of Education. We were also scheduled to be received by President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono (SBY), who had to cancel at the last minute due to the onset of flu. Earlier in the week we were
hosted by his Spokesman.
3. Nearly every Indonesian senior official with whom we met had been educated in the United States. But many of
the officials just below that level had not had this chance. Some characterized this cohort as a lost generation
and the senior officials all spoke about providing opportunities for this group now (through a ""re-charging" program
that the Government will fund) for short term study visits and about making sure that the next generation will now
have the chances that the most senior group once did to come to America for especially graduate education.
4. Indonesia, the 4th most populous country in the world, is the sixteenth-leading country of origin for students
coming to the U.S.; number 15 is Hong Kong (8200 students). A little more than 7600 Indonesians are currently
enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities. This is approximately half the number that were enrolled a decade
ago. The decline began in the wake of the Asian Economic Crisis of 1997 and accelerated after 2001 when there
were substantial visa issues and problems — coupled to a growing perception by Indonesians that America was an
unfriendly and not very welcoming country, especially for Muslims. At the same time, major campaigns were
launched by the governments of Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, China, Germany and the Netherlands to recruit
Indonesian students; today there are over 20,000 Indonesians studying in Australia alone. The appeal of these
countries also stems from the relative ease of applying to non-US higher education institutions and the willingness
to take students with low levels of English.

5. We did not hear a single visa complaint during our meetings and public forum. The U.S. embassy is on track to
issue a record number this year and now estimates that 80 percent of all student visa applications are being
granted.
6. The market for study abroad is probably very large. A recent poll by the Kompas newspaper found that 76.3% of
Indonesian students would prefer to go abroad for at least one degree. There are over 4.5 million final-year high
school students and 4.3 million currently enrolled in Indonesian universities, represent about a 17% enrollment
rate about the college-age cohort. The Government wants to raise this to 25% by 2011. This means adding over
400,000 new university students each year and doubling the size of the nation's entire teaching faculty. There are
approximately 154,000 faculty, but only 7% have any form of advance degrees and fewer than 5,000 have a
PhD. Capacity and quality challenges are huge.
7. We were repeatedly told that Higher Education is a top national priority and that the Government would like a
minimum international student enrollment of 5% in order to continue Indonesia's embrace of globalization nd
better prepare their students for work in a globalized world. A Higher Education Reform effort is just getting
underway, with initial emphasis on improving the quality and government support for science and
technology. There are over 2800 institutions of higher education, but only 86 public universities and
polytechnics. Enrollment in the public schools is about 1 million versus 3.4 million in private higher
education. The Government is coming to terms with how best to regulate the private sector; a recently-passed
law in Parliament calls for all private institutions to be brought under greater government control and oversight
over the next 6 years. All boards of trustees will by then have to report on their activities to a government
agency.
8. A very small number of Americans, 132 in 2006-2007, study abroad for credit and most do so on short term,
faculty-led study visits. The highest this number has ever been was only 215 (in 1994-1995). Most of the
delegation did not immediately see how they could send their students here for semester or year-long programs,
but an increasing number of courses are being taught in English at some leading universities. Almost all felt that
only Gadjah Made University in Yogyakarta was well set up to receive U.S. students and able to offer a significant
number of courses for them to take. Other institutions (especially in Bogor and possibly Bandung) offer promising
sites for field research in agriculture, environmental studies ,and marine science. Bali will remain an important
site for those in programs associated with the humanities and cultural studies.
9. Education Ministry officials stressed their desire to move rapidly to build on the momentum of this visit, create new
institutional partnerships, and expand educational programs under the official US-Indonesia Bilateral Partnership
proposed by President SBY (who went to the US six times during the course of his education and is a graduate of
Webster university) and endorsed by Secretary of State Clinton.

Subject: FW: Ellaboration on todays meeting.
Gentlemen, for your information below.
Werner
GFC
To whom it may concern from experience speaking!
RSO Niall,
Please be aware and as you have requested my elaboration in written format. As briefly
discussed in the meeting today, the LGF operate at what I would consider the ""Threshold'
Sleep Deprivation. Further meaning, that our work schedule, hours and sleeping pattern'
the LGF very close to the edge of serious sleep deprivation. When we have to work go.,
,
time or ramp up extra manpower (during scheduled off days) due to increased threw .
etc...etc...; we further compound the issue of sleep deprivation. This ultimately dirninit,:
LGF's ability to provide security.
To better explain, here is where it starts, the LGF work 3 days then transition (swing shift) into .
nights then transition into 3 days off (it used to be 2x2x2). Each work day equals 14 actin I I!(-)
of work; Supervisor's can average up to 15 hours per work day.
Snap shot of an average day for a shift:
1. 05:00hrs every day, Shift Brief for on-going shift, along with "In-Service Training". .I
Convoy Brief, followed by convoy load time and organization for entire shift (approx i
during the day) followed by actual convoy movement.
2. 05:45 to 06:15hrs. (approximately) you have the shift change over on site,
3. 06:15 to 17:45, regular work day on site.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764036 Date: 07/31/2015
4. 17:45 to 18:15, Shift change over, followed by reorganization of convoy for off-going. slii
then actual convoy movement
5. 18:30 (approximately) Off-going shift returns to Camp Sullivan, weapons and equipment are
down loaded and convoy equipment is stowed, vehicle's re-staged in parking lot.
6. 19:00 (approximately) Off-going shift is complete, all equipment is accounted for and
secured, they are then on personnel time whether to work out and train, eat dinner, watch
movie, internet, phone calls, sleep or etc.
7. 10 hours later, it starts all over with a 05:00hrs Shift Brief not taking into considers tit
wake-up and grooming and breakfast.
This averages an actual 14 hour day for each LGF member. Some days can be as short a,
hours and some days as long as 14.5 hours. Supervisor's can average an additional
(approximate) 30 minutes prior to and after a shift conducting administrative duties and or ,;1
organization. All personal hygiene, laundry, personal e-mail/matters, Physical fitness, usually
meals and sleep must be conducted within the 10 hour window between an individual's shifts.
After completing the 3 days in a work cycle which ends at 19:00hrs, the shifts swings into
night shift schedule. Their next duty starts at 17:00hrs the following day for the evening
briefmg. This is a 22 hour transition window which most LGF only sleep once and are
again with the same 14 hour schedule for their first night shift. This can be viewed as gea i
one good sleep in for a 36 hours window of time (by the end of their first night shift, fol
two more night shifts).
When finishing their last night shift, they are immediately off, however, do to working ah
(arriving back at Camp Sullivan around 06:30) they sleep most of the first day off. They the
have to adjust back into a night-time sleeping pattern. The second day off is a designated
training day. Third day is a scheduled off day.
If you average this work schedule out over the course of a month, an LGF member transitio',
from a day to night sleeping pattern on average of 7 times. It's nearly impossible to establish
rhythmic sleeping pattern. This is what causes the sleep deprivation. You can see its efftiek
over the course of time. When a shift gets back on ground after an R&R, they are fresh and rt,
of energy, as compared to a shift that is been in the grind for 7 or 8 weeks and sometint,:..
after 5 and 6 weeks.

In summary, a disruption or addition to the current work schedule further compounds t1.
sleep deprivation and is not sustainable by the LGF for extended periods of time.

I spoke to Ann and she sd that you always have the Trustee box to use in each House.
She cannot hold a box for The Secretary of State use only not - bt can further discussions with KC on this
She advises that we need to give advance notice -
There are 4 seat in the Eisenhower that are complimentary and then 4 that would need to be purchased for nominal fee
(seems like a really silly policy) The same for Opera and in the Symphony there are 12 all complimentary. I think if we
begin to use the box on a regular basis we can work with them on the cost issues.
This could be a lovely way to serve many special guests.
Let me know if you want to begin a process of reviewing the KC calendar and start a list of recommendations to invite.

It's 3 a.m. Do You Know Where Hillary Clinton Is?
By David Rothkopf
Washington Post
Sunday, August 23, 2009
When it comes to Hillary Rodham Clinton, we're missing the forest for the pantsuits.
Clinton is not the first celebrity to become the nation's top diplomat -- that honor goes to her most distant predecessor,
Thomas Jefferson, who by the time he took office was one of the most famous and gossiped-about men in America --
but she may be the biggest. And during her first seven months in office, the former first lady, erstwhile presidential
candidate and eternal lightning rod has drawn more attention for her moods, looks, outtakes and (of course)
relationship with her husband than for, well, her work revamping the nation's foreign policy.
Even venerable publications -- such as one to which I regularly contribute, Foreign Policy -- have woven into their all-
Hillary-all-the-time coverage odd discussions of Clinton's handbag and scarf choices. Daily Beast editor Tina Brown, while
depicting herself as a Clinton supporter, has been scathing and small-minded in discussing such things as Clinton's
weight and hair, while her ""defense" of Hillary in her essay "Obama's Other Wife" was as sexist as the title suggests.
Indeed, sexism has followed Clinton from the campaign trail to Foggy Bottom, as seen most recently in the posturing
outrage surrounding the exchange in Congo when Clinton reacted with understandable frustration to the now-infamous
question regarding her husband's views. Major media outlets have joined the gossipfest, whether the New York Times,
which covered Clinton's first big policy speech by discussing whether she was in or out with the White House, or The
Washington Post, where a couple of reporters mused about whether a brew called Mad Bitch would be the beer of
choice for the secretary of state.
Amid all the distractions, what is Clinton actually doing? Only overseeing what may be the most profound changes in
U.S. foreign policy in two decades -- a transformation that may render the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W.
Bush mere side notes in a long transition to a meaningful post-Cold War worldview.
The secretary has quietly begun rethinking the very nature of diplomacy and translating that vision into a revitalized
State Department, one that approaches U.S. allies and rivals in ways that challenge long-held traditions. And despite the
pessimists who invoked the "team of rivals" cliche to predict that President Obama and Clinton would not get along,
Hillary has defined a role for herself in the Obamaverse: often bad cop to his good cop, spine stiffener when it comes to
tough adversaries and nurturer of new strategies. Recognizing that the 3 a.m. phone calls are going to the White House,
she is instead tackling the tough questions that, since the end of the Cold War, have kept America's leaders awake all
night.
In these early days of the new administration, it has been easy to focus on what Clinton has not achieved or on ways in
which her power has been supposedly constrained. Indeed, some of her efforts have been frustrated by difficult
personnel approvals or disputes with the White House about who should get what jobs. But this is the way of all
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764432 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764432 Date: 07/31/2015
administrations. More unusual has been the avidity with which the new president has seized the reins of foreign policy --
more assertively than either George W. Bush or Bill Clinton before him. Obama's centrality amplifies the importance of
his closest White House staffers, while his penchant for appointing special envoys such as Richard Holbrooke (on
Afghanistan and Pakistan) and George Mitchell (on the Middle East) has been interpreted by some as limiting Clinton's
role.
Given the challenges involved, it was perhaps natural that the White House would have a bigger day-to-day hand in
some of the nation's most urgent foreign policy issues. But with Obama, national security adviser Jim Jones, Vice
President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates absorbed by Iraq, Afghanistan and other inherited problems
of the recent past, Clinton's State Department can take on a bigger role in tackling the problems of the future -- in
particular, how America will lead the world in the century ahead. This approach is both necessary and canny: It
recognizes that U.S. policy must change to fulfill Obama's vision and that many high-profile issues such as those of the
Middle East have often swamped the careers and aspirations of secretaries of state past.
Which nations will be our key partners? What do you do when many vital partners -- China, for example, and Russia --
are rivals as well? How must America's alliances change as NATO is stretched to the limit? How do we engage with rogue
states and old enemies in ways that do not strengthen them and preserve our prerogative to challenge threats? How do
we move beyond the diplomacy of men in striped pants speaking only for governments and embrace potent nonstate
players and once-disenfranchised peoples?
In searching for answers, Clinton is leaving behind old doctrines and labels. She outlined her new thinking in a recent
speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, where she revealed stark differences between the new
administration's worldview and those of its predecessors: The recurring themes include "partnership" and
"engagement" and "common interests." Clearly, Madeleine Albright's "indispensable nation" has recognized the
indispensability of collaborating with others.
Who those "others" are is the area in which change has been greatest and most rapid. "We will put," Clinton said,
"special emphasis on encouraging major and emerging global powers -- China, India, Russia and Brazil, as well as Turkey,
Indonesia and South Africa -- to be full partners in tackling the global agenda." This is the death knell for the G-8 as the
head table of the global community; the administration has an effort underway to determine whether the successor to
the G-8 will be the G-20, or perhaps some other grouping. Though the move away from the G-8 began in the waning
days of the Bush era, that administration viewed the world through a different lens, a perception that evolved from a
traditional great-power view to a pre-Galilean notion that everything revolved around the world's sole superpower.
Obama and Clinton have both made engaging with emerging powers a priority. Obama visited Russia earlier this year
and will host Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his first state dinner in November. Clinton has made trips to
China and India, and she would have been with Obama in Russia had she not injured her elbow. Both have visited Africa
and the Middle East, reaching out to women and the Islamic world.
On many critical agenda items -- from a rollback of nuclear weapons to the climate or trade talks -- such emerging
powers will be essential to achieving U.S. goals. As a result, we've seen a new American willingness to play down old
differences, whether with Russia on a missile shield or, as Clinton showed on her China trip, with Beijing on human
rights.
At the center of Clinton's brain trust is Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former dean of Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of
Public and International Affairs. Now head of policy planning at the State Department, Slaughter elaborated on the ideas
in Clinton's speech. "We envision getting not just a new group of states around a table, but also building networks,
coalitions and partnerships of states and nonstate actors to tackle specific problems," she told me.
"To do that," Slaughter continued, "our diplomats are going to need to have skills that are closer to community
organizing than traditional reporting and analysis. New connecting technologies will be vital tools in this kind of
diplomacy."

A new team has been brought in to make these changes real. Clinton recruited Alec Ross, one of the leaders of Obama's
technology policy team, to the seventh floor of the State Department as her senior adviser for innovation. His mission is
to harness new information tools to advance U.S. interests -- a task made easier as the Internet and mobile networks
have played starring roles in recent incidents, from Iran to the Uighur uprising in western China to Moldova. Whether
through a telecommunications program in Congo to protect women from violence or text messaging to raise money for
Pakistani refugees in the Swat Valley, technology has been deployed to reach new audiences.
Of course, you need more than new ideas to revitalize the State Department; you need resources, too. The secretary has
brought in former Bill Clinton-era budget chief Jack Lew to help her claw back money for statecraft that many in Foggy
Bottom feel has been sucked off toward the Pentagon. She has also created special positions to back new priorities, such
as Melanne Verveer as ambassador at large for women's issues, Elizabeth Bagley to handle public-private outreach
worldwide and Todd Stern as the chief negotiator on climate.
Even just a few months in, it's clear that these appointments are far from window dressing. Lew, Slaughter and the
acting head of the U.S. Agency for International Development are leading an effort to rethink foreign aid with the new
Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, an initiative modeled on the Pentagon's strategic assessments and
designed to review State's priorities. Stern has conducted high-level discussions on climate change around the world,
notably with China. Clinton made women's issues a centerpiece of her recent 11-day trip to Africa, where she stressed
that "the social, political and economic marginalization of women across Africa has left a void in this continent that
undermines progress and prosperity."
Clinton has also signaled the importance of private-sector experience by naming former Goldman Sachs International
vice chairman Robert Hormats, a respected veteran of four administrations, to handle economic issues at the State
Department, as well as Judith McHale, former chief executive of Discovery Communications, to run public diplomacy. In
the same vein, she has opened up Cuba to American telecommunications companies and reached out to India's private
sector on energy cooperation -- showing that this administration will seek to advance national interests by tapping the
self-interests of the business community. As with any new administration, there have been inevitable problems. The old
campaign teams -- Clinton's and Obama's -- still eye each other warily, but this feeling is gradually fading. And by most
accounts, the administration's national security team has come together successfully, with Clinton developing strong
relationships with national security adviser Jones and Defense Secretary Gates. Her policy deputy, Jim Steinberg, has
renewed an old collaboration with deputy national security adviser Tom Donilon; the two of them, working with Obama
campaign foreign policy advisers Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert, have formed what one State Department
seventh-floor dweller called "a powerful quartet at the heart of real interagency policymaking." Henry Kissinger may
have overstated matters when he said this is the best White House-State relationship in recent memory, but it's not bad,
while the State-Pentagon relationship is in its best shape in decades.
At the heart of things, though, is the relationship between Clinton and Obama. For all the administration's talk of
international partnerships, that may be the most critical partnership of all.
So far, according to multiple high-level officials at State and the White House, the two seem aligned in their views. In
addition, they are gradually defining complementary roles. Obama has assumed the role of principal spokesperson on
foreign policy, as international audiences welcome his new and improved American brand. Clinton thus far has echoed
his points but has also delivered tougher ones. Whether on a missile shield against Iran or North Korean saber-rattling,
the continued imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma or rape and corruption in Congo, the secretary of state has
spoken bluntly on the world stage -- even if it triggered snide comments from North Korea.
It is still early, and a president's foreign policy legacy is often defined less by big principles than by how one reacts to the
unexpected, whether missiles in Cuba or terrorism in New York. Promising ideas fail because of limited attention or
reluctant bureaucracies, and some rhetoric eventually rings hollow, as the self-congratulatory "smart power" already
does to me.

Nevertheless, there is evidence that, seven months into the job, Obama's unlikely secretary of state is supporting and
augmenting his agenda effectively. Not as Obama's "other wife," not as Bill Clinton's wife, not even as a celebrity or as a
former presidential candidate -- but in a new role of her own making.

Barack Obama snubs Gordon Brown over private
talks
White House spurned five requests from PM's aides for bilateral meeting

London in April 2009. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reufers
Gordon Brown lurched from being hailed as a global statesman to intense embarrassment tonight, after it
emerged US President Barack Obama had turned down no fewer than five requests from Downing Street to
hold a bilateral meeting at the United Na tions in New York or at the G20 summit starting in Pittsburgh today.
The prime minister, eager to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage in America this week,
was also forced to play down suggestions from inside his own party that he might step down early, either due to
ill health or deteriorating eyesight.
There have been tensions between the White House and No 10 for weeks over Brown's handling of the Scottish
government's decision to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.
Brown's efforts to secure a prestigious primetime slot for his keynote speech at the general assembly in New
York were also thwarted when the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, delivered a 100-minute speech to the UN,
massively running over Brown's 15 minute slot.
Brown had not only been seeking a bilateral meeting with Obama, but feelers were also sent out to hold a joint
press conference, an event that would have boosted Brown's efforts to offer himself as a linchpin of
international diplomacy. Government sources said that Britain even changed its policy on swine flu
immunisation in Africa to match that of the Obama administration last week, in an attempt to rebuild relations.
No 10 denied there had been any hint of a snub, saying Obama and Brown had plenty of chances to talk as they
sat next to one another at the summits. They insisted they were working closely on issues such as future
economic regulation, bankers' bonuses, nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. Brown himself insisted: ""I
do say that the special relationship is strong, it continues to strengthen."
But Obama has held bilateral meetings in New York with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, the Russian
president, Dmitry Medvedev, and the new Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama.
News of the five spurned approaches compounded a miserable day for Brown at home which saw a
parliamentary aide resign over the prime minister's refusal to sack Lady Scotland, the attorney general, after she
was fined £5,000 for employing an illegal immigrant, as well as a withering attack by the former home secretary
Charles Clarke.
Stephen Hesford, Labour MP for Wirral West, told Brown in a resignation letter: "In my view, the facts of the
case do not matter. It is the principle which counts, particularly at a time when the public's trust of Whitehall is
uncertain to say the least. We have to be seen to be accountable."
Brown was also savaged by Charles Clarke, who told the Evening Standard that in his view Brown's leadership
risked letting "the whole Labour ship crash on to the rocks of May 2010 [the expected date of the general
election] and sink for a very long time". He said he hoped rumours that Brown would quit would come true. "I
think his own dignity ought to look to that kind of solution."
In two interviews , Brown was forced for the first time to field questions about his health. "My sight is not at all
deteriorating," he told NBC.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764892 Date: 07/31/2015
Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he might quit for health reasons, the prime minister replied: "I am healthy
and I am very fit. I run a lot to keep fit and I will continue to keep fit.
"I keep going. I have got a job to do. I have got work to do. We have got to meet this challenge."
In his own speech to the UN, Obama promised an end to the unilateralism marked by the previous Bush
administration, an approach that saw US and Britain working in tandem. In remarks that suggest Obama will
focus on broadening American alliances across the globe, he said: "The time has come for the world to move in
a new direction ... a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect."
Last week, the White House had unusually briefed that Obama had told B rown in a phone conversation that he
disapproved of the release of the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds, something No 10 had not
highlighted. Megrahi was released on the basis that he had three months to live, and then received a hero's
welcome as he returned to Tripoli.
Brown had said he respected the release, but insisted undertakings by the Libyans that the return would be low-
key had been broken.
In an attempt to distance himself from the Libyans, Brown moved to toughen his position against Colonel
Gaddafi after Libya's leader theatrically tore up the UN charter in his address. Gaddafi said the security council
should be renamed "the terror council".
Brown countered in his speech in New York later: "I am here to reaffirm the UN charter, not to tear it up. I call
on everyone to support its universal principles."
He urged world leaders to recognise that the next six months presented tests on climate change and terrorism
that were as huge as the banking crisis. On climate change he said: "If we miss this opportunity to protect our
planet, we cannot hope for a second chance some time in the future. There will be no retrospective global
agreement to undo the damage we have caused. This is the moment now to limit and reverse climate change we
are inflicting on future generations."
He added: "If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt, if the emerging economies are
going to embark on low-carbon development paths, if the forest nations are going to slow and stop
deforestation, then the richer countries must contribute financially."
No 10 again denied that the prime minister had been snubbed last night. A spokesman said the stories were
"without foundation. As we have said throughout the week, the prime minister and President Obama are having
a number of meetings throughout the week. These included a wide-ranging discussion following last night's
climate change dinner. They will also be co-chairing an important meeting on Thursday on Pakistan and the
fight against terrorism. As the prime minister has already said, there will be further meetings at the G20 summit
in Pittsburgh."

Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as 'special
relationship' sinks to new low
Gordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama
during his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release of
the Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left ""the special relationship"
at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.
By Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New York
Published: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009
British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy
change in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources.
But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing
on his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York
kitchen.
The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point
since John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.
It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite the
President hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed that
this was not unusual.
However, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown had
been a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.
"It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone," the source said.
"There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off."
The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on
supplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.
As a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, according to a senior
source. However, the meeting never happened.
The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would
"spend all day Friday together." However, Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of world
leaders.
The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind the
new chill in relations between Washington and London.
Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.
Downing Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.
Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.

Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, families
of victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made
speeches.
Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal
discussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The
15-minute "walk and chat" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in
Manhattan.
No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate "bilateral"
meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting
with Mr Obama.
In a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must "move in a new direction" and "embrace20a
new era of engagement". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on
relations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poor
relationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who enjoyed close
friendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.
John Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major had
tried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton's
student past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied.
Mr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for
96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.
Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled to
New York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of
justice for victims families.
The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order
to safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.
Shirin Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y than
human rights.
Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guests
paid $1,000 to attend the function attended by, among others, Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono.

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The ""surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick
up on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed
information about Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of
things that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and
much more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as "and this day, and the next day" as My Life,
it does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that
there appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore,
WJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC
quotes was far fewer than I had expected.
HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with
Branch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the
Gephardt comment, and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought
that there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much
aligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in
the book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion
of the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his
connection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are
strikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not
appear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life,
one theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages
about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you
would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his
chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch
could write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends,
later quashed, who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does
portray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks
Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from
Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye, such
as WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize."

Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no
other lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason
he didn't mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if
she was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a
very small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this
before. (This is addressed more fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship
with Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with
Janet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues
are discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed
in a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her
relationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.
On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans,
China, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about
Haiti is about Branch's own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion
about North Korea, but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in
what seems to track mention of him in My Life, which seems to have more detail and background than this
book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the
USSS cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets
would be lined with "assassins." There are candid looks at WJC's take on certain people and the relationship
between some, such as Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's
drinking, such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders
going, but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's
Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained
interpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Life
only mentions Lee's accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from
Branch's book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
➢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security
agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his
personal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown,
solitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to
China or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their
treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him more
than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
➢ While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret, uncharged
and untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without
foreseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the
legal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his
dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extreme
detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American. We accept guilty
people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.' [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could
send her to jail, as she had denied it.
➢ "Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of
the affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could
have turned him into a witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while
original, struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his
steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.
➢ There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he
complained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to
say "it was interesting, in fact, that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His
visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet, announcing gladly that his worries were over because
the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's
dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched,
speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered that
his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,'
Hillary repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life.'
[Branch, 179]
HRC and gay/lesbian

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764995 Date: 07/31/2015
Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WJC's counsel got very "exercised." WJC left
the room. "He was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life
than Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues
were even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take.
On the other hand, personal experience could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with
Moynihan. For example:
> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could
fight for themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a
freebie for him,' snapped Clinton, 'and he knows it.'" [p.140]
> In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan
for aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]
➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a
number of them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was
sure they had nothing to hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan
skated blithely on the surface, never produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny
himself for five minutes, living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania
Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182]
➢ "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted
hypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, "He doesn't understand...that he's
conceding the principles." WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press
and said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption about
Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several
examples follow:
➢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the
Clintons, with the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was a
delicate race between Hussein's failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president
said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders, water
disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, and so on. Hussein
gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch, 170]
> South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule was far more
demanding than ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden
women." [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast with
a superficial American press, which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in
exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements for
citizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds to
a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, "she [HRC] played the traditional role of First
Lady as wife and mother...") [Branch, 246]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764995 Date: 07/31/2015
> China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she
depicted the "harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the
rave reviews of HRC's speech. [Branch, 289]
➢ Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed from
urgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact
with her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs
gratitude, but the fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.
➢ "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called
Chelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was
another story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in
American politics. He did not know everything involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much
her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all, and if she needed to counsel,
rage, or pray, he was always available." [Branch, 497]
Tension with Janet Reno
Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative
opinion of Janet Reno.
> "He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney
general. If he removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996
campaign finance] would fall to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's
wholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become a
target...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would touch off a firestorm of protest
like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.
That was not an option." [Branch, 388-389]
> Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and
continuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.
Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her
"desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't
hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'" [Branch,
398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements including
coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater,
but that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno
had failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension
the entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her
more naïve than upright, and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch, 399] He cites
that Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire second
term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter

There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to
North Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be
on the front lines.
North Korea:
➢ "On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore,
and Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme
isolation... Sure enough, Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, who proposed to allow
inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.
The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official, adding
gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters,
and he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt.' [Branch,
162]
Haiti:
➢ After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with
Gore (who said Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to
Haiti to seek a truce with the junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis'
(arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States' best interest). He
didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea, Carter again, Carter went to
the press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and Carter, invited to stay
over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the next
morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not
right...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent
negotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to
Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton
found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference, he
allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he had earned the right to
speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the United States
government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-
resident." [Branch, 200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
➢ "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and
Bush. 'Dole will support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he
doesn't have much positive to say." [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places
where he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the
seemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.
➢ On page 92 Branch writes, "No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as
alleged, but to improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser
Tony Lake, boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les
Aspin." [Branch, 92]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764995 Date: 07/31/2015
➢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also
having Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other
nations were offended that Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to
redeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC
"pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.
`Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Gore
erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and were still
wrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]
➢ On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as
a team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.
➢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second
criminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is
about a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.
The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
➢ On Gore's announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his
kickoff events—once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were
technical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself
from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House.
The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.'
First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third, Gore would be
badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'" [Branch, 553-554]
Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his
campaign. "On tape, the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to
Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood, precisely
how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him off
substance." [Branch, 554]
➢ WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not
succeeding him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart,
experience, and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential
character over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," but Clinton discounted
this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also was
perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence, which called for Gore to
emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a brooding
quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature
failed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch, 599]
➢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe
me, said the president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had
it not been for the vice president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who
would be a bright spot to run with, perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into
great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though she would never get chosen. How much of this
was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
➢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be running
essentially for a third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would

tarnish them with Clinton's character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate
that had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch.
➢ Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in one
of their stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he
meant good on the policy, and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend
the two. Gore said he had to think about it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He
had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehow
without seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch, 623-624]
➢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure
at first about recording the details. At the outset it says, "For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did
he blame Clinton for his defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him
did." [Branch, 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the
White House. Then he says, "'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,'"
Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your message,
now that we're being honest.'" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that
"Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an "unparalleled" vice
president, but that he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was
"surreal."
o Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising
scandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal
integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore said
he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered telling the president that
he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for
trouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the
ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought
he was in Neverland,' he said." [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported
Clinton all through the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself
disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did
not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little to
say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake.
He had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.
Well, he said, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double
take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both of
them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so significant
here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed
honesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..." [Branch,
644-45]

➢ Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking
Maggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. "Williams was shrewd, discreet,
and efficient." [Branch, 161]

> HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's
suggestion to invade Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the
pressure, the lack of options, and his sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign
policy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake,
Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray
Inman as defense secretary." [Branch, 189]
> ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book.
Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn.
HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft
chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as a
ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a female
veterinarian of Socks' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House." [Branch,
342-343]
> Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had
subpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were
there. This included "some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed the
subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]
➢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, "In our
glancing associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as
lighthearted or recreational." [Branch, 495]
> Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their
best chance to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, tut I don't think Al
would ever do it.'" [Branch, 540]
> WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting
HRC if she decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the
two events are unconnected. "When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the
New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..."
[Branch, 557]
➢ On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because "of hard
intelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses
the cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.
DI 'Gephardt is an asshole," Hillary commented. The president, pointing to my recorders, advised gently that the tapes were on. She
winced but shrugged with a smile. "Well, he is," she insisted. In an awkward silence, I backed up both machines to erase the first
lady's epithet." [Branch, 263]

Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the World
By Joe Klein
Time Magazine
Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009
It was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. ""We're prepared to start
peace talks immediately," the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton standing at his side, poker-faced. "I think we should ... get on it and get with it."
It was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their
leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West
Bank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a
partial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was
a nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an "unprecedented" offer,
Netanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)
It was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had
softened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli
"restraint" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat, agreeing that
Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, "unprecedented," even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most
important thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the
Palestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab
neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan "falls far short" of
U.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it "unprecedented," which was neither diplomatic nor wise.
Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on
Netanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,
privately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talks
without preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton
had violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.)
Clinton's Three Qualities
For the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go
to Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there "guardedly optimistic" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the
Israelis or Palestinians move, a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The
breakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go to
Jerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765145 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765145 Date: 07/31/2015
reach what appears to be a breakthrough — they're talking! — which then becomes another dead end.
The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,
is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,
diplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the
National Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors have
distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was
Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James
Baker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have
been frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about — the second most popular American in
the world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking
headline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.
It is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The
conventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton's
reticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the
heavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she
becomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.
Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the
Obama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum
looms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?
Traditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the
striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign
indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian
idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem
indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.
There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of
departmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy
— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the
office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand
and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an
international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to
the President's — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.
She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although
her performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed
tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,
Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems
far more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton's
campaign.)
Independence and Candor
In the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the
behest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.
In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her
independence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after
an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — "Can't we all just get along?" — phase.
During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been
unprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765145 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765145 Date: 07/31/2015
specialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had
been bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. "We
saw her praying there," an academic named Shala Aziz told me, "and, for the first time, I'm thinking, The Americans have
hearts."(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)
The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts
and Pashturi elders -- and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the
Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press
accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton's
undiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,
had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the
Pakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast
was especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez
Musharraf. "In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home," said Farahnaz
Ispahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. "Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile
or not, has made a big impression — and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it
means so much more."
Transformative Experience
There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and
Clinton's — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.
Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album
of photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and
daughter Chelsea. "It did bring tears to my eyes," Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,
"because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..." She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,
talking about the "reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all."
Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I
believe, of the•process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when
we set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994
congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very
personal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.
Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was
Chelsea's spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy
czar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously
ridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs.
"That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable," Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her
Jerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing
glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. "I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I've
done since," she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.
Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: "Women's rights are human
rights."(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)
Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years
of insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.
When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside
Bhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. "She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar
kameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did
anything like that," Clinton says.
When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765145 Date: 07/31/2015
Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking
Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, "I used to be able
to walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can't." When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —
"The Saudis," who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, and
participation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so
inadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)
Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education and
health care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State
Department but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones -
schools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result, there
was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army's counterinsurgency
manual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At
one point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential
Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, "You mean, aside from Hillary?"
It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke ("my two alpha males," she calls them) for the first time -
at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the
military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than
usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In
fact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.
Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID
director, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. "It was all sorts of niggling things," says a Clinton adviser, "like, Farmer had
at one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the
amount was illegal."
Another of Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, "I'm a Republican. I disagree with her
about practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief." There is a palpable toughness to the
woman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest
exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the "bluster" of George W. Bush
after she said the U.S. would be able to "obliterate" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tone
has been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli
settlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted "to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not
outposts, not natural-growth exceptions." And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a
rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read "Clinton's Collateral Damage.")
The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps
removed from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:
whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of
the room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the
de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.
Hillary's Choice
The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in
substantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is
willing to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;
neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing
perception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems
ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there's no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain
recalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on
human rights with no apparent quid pro quos.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765145 Date: 07/31/2015
The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will
return to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for "strategic patience." But the only thing Obama
really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have
refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force -
the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this
Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn't happen
overnight, but for Obama's policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be
explained to the public.
There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which
represents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but
in his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace
hunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;
if it doesn't, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is
accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. "You can't be seen pushing countries around — demanding
[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results," says Leslie
H. Gelb, author of Power Rules. "The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they'll begin to take
you less seriously." (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)
Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise
for the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also
burblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for
the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the
uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.
These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that
the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New
York, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,
though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President's
primary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials
have spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. "Either
you have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President," says a former
Republican Secretary of State, "or there is no message."(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)
Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged
that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television
is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely
guarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President's alter ego
on foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates — but he's a
Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones
has settled in as National Security Adviser, but he's not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign
policy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.
Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning
the $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. "How much damage control
have you been able to do on this trip?" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton's
meeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. "I don't know," she
said. "I hope some."
Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. "Well, this trip was long overdue," she said. "The Pakistani
people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone
attacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the
damage control" — she paused, thinking it through — "I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot."

In the end, though, Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.
She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who
knows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.

RELEASE IN FULL
Why the Greg Craig debacle matters
By: Elizabeth Drew
November 19, 2009 11:58 AM EST
President Barack Obama is returning from his trek to Asia Thursday to a capital that is a
considerably more dangerous place for him than when he departed.
While he was abroad, there was a palpable sense at home of something gone wrong. A
critical mass of influential people who once held big hopes for his presidency began to
wonder whether they had misjudged the man. Most significant, these doubters now find
themselves with a new reluctance to defend Obama at a phase of his presidency when he
needs defenders more urgently than ever.
This is the price Obama has paid with his complicity and most likely his active
participation, in the shabbiest episode of his presidency: The firing by leaks of White
House counsel Gregory Craig, a well-respected Washington veteran and influential early
supporter of Obama.
The people who are most aghast by the handling of the Craig departure can't be
dismissed by the White House as Republican partisans, or still-embittered Hillary Clinton
supporters. They are not naïve activists who don't understand that the exercise of power
can be a rough business and that trade-offs and personal disappointments are inevitable.
Instead, they are people, either in politics or close observers, who once held an
unromantically high opinion of Obama. They were important to his rise, and are likely
more important to the success or failure of his presidency than Obama or his distressingly
insular and small-minded West Wing team appreciate.
The Craig embarrassment gives these people a new reason — not the first or only reason
— to conclude that he wasn't the person of integrity and even classiness they had thought,
and, more fundamentally, that his ability to move people and actually lead a fractured and
troubled country (the reason many preferred him over Hillary Clinton) is not what had been
promised in the campaign.
This may seem like a lot to hang on a Washington personnel move. After all, intramural
back-stabbing or making people fall guys when things go wrong (think Bill Clinton's
Defense Secretary Les Aspin after the disaster in Somalia) are not new to
Washingtonians.
But Craig's ouster did not occur in a vacuum. It served as a focal point to concerns that
have been building for months that Obama wasn't pressing for all that might be possible
within the existing political constraints (all that one could ask of a president); that his
presidential voice hadn't fulfilled the hopes raised by his campaign voice (which had also
taken him a while to find); that he hadn't created a movement, as he had raised
expectations that he would; that would be there to back him up and help him fulfill his
promises.
That is why it is worth pondering how the Craig story, unfolded in detail — its
consequences likely will echo far longer than anything Obama said or did in Asia.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765355 Date: 07/31/2015
Briefly, here's what happened, some of it told for the first time: Craig, who had known the
Clintons since they were all at Yale Law School together, had served as a senior adviser
to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, but in 1998 gave up that job to help defend Bill
Clinton against impeachment. Yet in 2008, he supported Obama for the nomination — not
so much a turning against Hillary Clinton as being impressed early, as were some other
prominent Washingtonians, by the then-state senator but would-be U.S. Senate candidate
at a fundraiser held by Vernon Jordan, seeing Obama as the first potentially inspiring
Democratic figure since Robert Kennedy. In the course of the campaign, Craig wrote a
highly publicized memo questioning some of Hillary Clinton's claims of foreign policy
experience, such as coming under enemy fire in Tuzla, Bosnia. During the campaign,
Craig coached Obama for the debates (playing McCain), and praised him highly. Craig's
imprimatur helped the neophyte Obama in certain influential circles.
He hoped to get a high foreign policy position in an Obama administration, but when
Clinton was named secretary of state, this of course became untenable. The Clintons are
an unforgiving lot. So, Obama and Craig agreed that Craig would take the job of White
House counsel for a year, and then they'd discuss what he'd do next. Thus, Craig was
handed a very tricky portfolio.
During the transition, about mid-December, Craig presented to a group of the president's
newly named national security advisers meeting in Washington — including Clinton,
Defense Secretary Robert Gates, national security adviser General James Jones, and
others — three proposed executive orders: One ordered the shutting down of Guantanamo
in a year. (The others banned torture and closed down the C.I.A.'s ""black sites"; and
addressed future detainee policy.) The one-year target for closing Guantanamo resulted
from consultations with human rights and detainee rights groups, who argued that
Guantanamo could be shut down in three months, and with Pentagon officials, who had
no united position but argued that it would take from a year to 18 months.
At the meeting, only the newly named Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano,
beamed in from Arizona, questioned whether a year was realistic. When Gates, as he
later confirmed publicly, said that though it was an "ambitious" deadline, he supported it
because setting it was the only way to get things, especially the bureaucracy, moving
toward that end, and that it could be extended if it couldn't be met, that was it.
Obama's new national security team signed off on the executive order to close
Guantanamo in a year. This was passed along to the president as well as his top aides;
Craig was never in a meeting with the political side of the White House on the
Guantanamo matter — and the president-elect and then president raised no objection
before, when, or after he signed off on it.
Unsurprisingly, the deadline became hard to meet, for various legal and political reasons -
including the congressional outburst of NIMBYISM (similar to its earlier outbursts on Dubai
Ports and even Terri Schiavo — short-term, irrational, and politically motivated fits that
erupt from the Congress from time to time). If Craig failed to foresee this (as some later
charged), he had a lot of company.
The closing of Guantanamo is undoubtedly far further along than it would have been
without the executive order. But along the way, Craig fell out of favor with the president's
political aides and, apparently, the president himself. Whether he was simply being made
the fall guy, or the tight circle of Chicagoans in the White House didn't care for this
outsider, or he committed some unknown errors, suddenly, in August, leaks began to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765355 Date: 07/31/2015
surface that his job was in danger. Non-denial denials were issued from the White House.
The leaks became a pattern, a systematic, anonymous, tipping off of reporters that Craig
would soon be gone.
Craig was accused, anonymously of course, of a welter of charges: of being "too close to
the human rights groups" (if so, what was wrong with that?), of not playing well with
others, of being a bad manager, of being fixated on Guantanamo to the detriment of other
issues. In the summer, Obama offered Craig another job, which Craig declined, and the
two agreed that they would discuss the matter further later in the year. But the leaks
continued, and Craig decided that his situation was untenable, and he had to leave.
To make sure he did, he was leaked his way out, up to the day before he planned to
.resign. What caused so many Obama supporters' stomachs to turn was that Obama could
have stopped the leaking at any time; he or White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel
could have arranged a dignified departure. (They're within their rights to get rid of
someone if they're dissatisfied, for good reasons or not — but a preferred route would be to
call that person in and ask what day would suit him or her to resign, and then just let that
person do it. This happens a lot in administrations; even if people don't believe the
resignation was voluntary, there's a soupcon of dignity left to that person.) Even some
Hillary Clinton supporters, who still hold no brief for Craig, think he was treated shabbily.
And this opinion is not confined to "political junkies." Thomas Wilner, a distinguished
Washington attorney who challenged Bush administration detainee policies, particularly on
Guantanamo, and had worked with Craig on these issues, told me, "There's a lot of
concern among a lot of lawyers in this town, especially those who were supporting
Obama, that somebody this bright, this respected, this good, and with this integrity, was
treated in such a way."
Yes, we knew, or should have, during the campaign that the supposed idealist Obama
had a bit of the Chicago cut-throat in him, but there was little sign that he could be as
brutal and heedless of loyalty as he was in the Craig affair. An unexpected climate of fear
emanates from the Obama White House.
The incident underscored worries that several had held about the Obama White House for
some time: that it was too tightly controlled and narrowly focused by the Chicago crowd;
that it seemed from the outset to need an older, wiser head, someone with a bit more
detachment.
The current crowd displays a certain impulsiveness and vindictiveness that do it no good -
as in the silly war-let on Fox News that it is now trying to back out of. Even if Craig was
making a hash of his job — and there's no independent evidence of this — it just wasn't
smart to treat someone widely held in such high respect in this manner; once again, the
impulsiveness backfired.
The replacing of Craig with Washington attorney Robert Bauer, Obama's own attorney for
years as well as counsel for the Democratic National Committee and the Obama
campaign, further narrowed the White House circle just when it needed broadening,
lowered the stature of the office, and choosing the president's personal attorney for a
position that calls for dispassionate judgment is hazardous. (Does anyone remember
Alberto Gonzalez?)
The Obama's themselves hang tight with a small Chicago crowd. Yes, he talks to others,
and yes, a president's time is very limited, but the Obama's themselves seem as closed-
off and unto themselves as does his inner White House circle. (Is this a coincidence?

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765355 Date: 07/31/2015
What is all this wariness about?) When the Obama's go to someone's house for dinner,
almost invariably it's to that of Valerie Jarrett, the old friend from Chicago who serves as a
counselor and whom they see all day. Old Chicago friends fly in for weekends frequently.
Old friends, who had helped launch him, helped them personally, have been left behind.
At the same time as the Craig imbroglio happened, many people who had defended
Obama against charges that he wasn't what he'd been cracked up to be were now
becoming concerned themselves: though it was a relief to have a president who thought
through crucial decisions about sending the country's young to war, it was taking him
awfully long to make up his mind about what to do about Afghanistan and Pakistan, and
the decision-making was bafflingly leak-ridden (was this a deliberate airing of ideas or a
loss of control over the process?); that the health care debate had in fact careened out of
his control and it seemed less and less likely that, having used up almost a year of his
presidency on it (his "deadlines" had become irrelevant, and so, in a way, had he), he
would end up with a bill, if at all, that did enough net good.
Certain things are not his fault: the unprecedented truculence of the Republican Party,
scared silly by right-wing ranters on cable television; the unholy economic and foreign-
policy mess that he inherited; the fact that he never had, as so many liberal commentators
asserted, the 60 (or 58 or 59) Senate votes that would enable him to get what he wanted
from the Congress. It's not his fault that unemployment rates remain stubbornly high
following a traumatic recession.
And it's always risky to project the long-term from the moment. Perhaps this will prove to
have been a passing moment. Perhaps Obama will still salvage a health care bill that is a
real step forward (though there will be a humongous fight over its definition); maybe he'll
come up with a smart strategy — or the best of bad options — on Afghanistan and Pakistan;
it's not impossible that he'll add real progress on climate change and regulatory reform to
his list of achievements, and that he'll start to get the deficit under control.
Maybe there'll be enough examples of grace that will make people forget this period of
pettiness. He's been lucky before; maybe he'll get lucky again. Meanwhile, serious people
who had a lot of hope about him and who defended him are more worried than ever, and
in this if anything over-communicative society the White House can't write them off as "a
bunch of Washington insiders." So meanwhile, there's a palpable mood change in
Washington that could signify that Barack Obama is in deeper trouble than he was even a
week ago.

Just following up on a few items.
First, see below on Nagorno-Karabakh.
Third, on QME, Gates and Barak are meeting the week of UNGA and we are holding until then if you are comfortable
with that.
Fourth, Declan Kelly is going to be in Belfast Monday and Tuesday with Lou Susman. I will be there Tuesday for all of the
official meetings. Declan and I will stay Tuesday night after Lou leaves and have dinner with a broad cross-section of
folks.
Fifth, I'm working with Holbrooke's and Lew's shops on the materials for Af/Pak, and we'll have a concept paper over
the weekend on the UNGA curtain raiser.
Sixth, Mike Fuchs and I met with Team WHA on Mexico, following up on Carlos' memo. Mike is working with WHA to
ensure that we create a productive agenda and outcomes for the Merida meeting you will participate in at UNGA.
(SBU) Reports about an alleged lethal incident along the line of contact in Nagorno-Karabakh remain
unconfirmed. The potential implications on the peace process are not yet clear. At the moment, regional
leaders are responding cautiously and the impact on other regional processes does not appear
significant. The Armenian Ministry of Defense denied any unusual activity along the line of contact; the
Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense told media that incidents are frequent along the line of contact. Embassy
Yerevan reports that it is customary to deny reports of sniper incidents along the line of contact, but that an
incident of this magnitude would be difficult to cover up. Embassy Baku notes that President Aliyev is in
Kazakhstan and local authorities could be waiting for his return before deciding on how to proceed. Neither of
our Embassies have been able to confirm local media reports.

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The ""surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick up on—
the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed information about
Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of things that have been covered
in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and much more focused on Branch than I
had anticipated. While not as "and this day, and the next day" as My Life, it does share many of the same elements that
would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that there appears to be no index also makes it difficult
for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore, WJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection
through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC quotes was far fewer than I had expected.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765941 Date: 07/31/2015
HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with Branch
when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the Gephardt comment,
and didn't grab much attention at al1.[11 (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought that there should not be a
special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much aligned with her interactions with
Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in the book are those, which face the current
Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion of the
Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his connection with the
events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are strikingly sparsely discussed
such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not appear as thought WJC ever-dodged
questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life, one theme that repeated itself was WJC's
conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few
instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there
are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on
more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch could
write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends, later quashed,
who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does portray a helpful distinction in
how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have
him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are
some quips that could catch someone's eye, such as WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't
even recognize."
Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no other
lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason he didn't
mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if she was found to
be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a very small passage that
could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this before. (This is addressed more
fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship with Gore,
which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with Janet Reno. The
one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues are discussed in turn
below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed in a much more human light
than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her relationship with CVC and images of
affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.

On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans, China, Russia,
Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about Haiti is about Branch's own
experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion about North Korea, but nothing that has
not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in what seems to track mention of him in My Life,
which seems to have more detail and background than this book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the USSS
cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets would be lined
with "assassins." There are candid looks at WIC's take on certain people and the relationship between some, such as
Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's drinking, such as yelling outside of
Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders going, but
Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained interpretation of
the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Life only mentions Lee's
accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from Branch's book the first giving context
and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
0 The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security agencies,
indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his personal computer. Lee
was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown, solitary confinement—even though the
long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to China or anyone else. The president said experts were
telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged.
Nothing would please him more than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
0 While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret, uncharged and
untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without foreseeing such arbitrary
detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the legal limit...whether to bring charges on the
testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for
more than six months. One extreme detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American.
We accept guilty people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom." [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could send her
to jail, as she had denied it.
0 "Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of the affair. If
Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could have turned him into a
witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while original, struck me as tendentious. The
president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of
Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.
14
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765941 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765941 Date: 07/31/2015
0 There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he complained that
if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to say "it was interesting, in fact,
that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet,
announcing gladly that his worries were over because the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she
replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She
said Kissing blanched, speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered
that his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,' Hillary
repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life." [Branch, 179]
HRC and gay/lesbian
Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WIC's counsel got very "exercised." WJC left the room. "He
was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life than Hillary.' He sighed. Her
temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues were even mentionable. New York
politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take. On the other hand, personal experience
could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with Moynihan.
For example:
0 When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could fight for
themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a freebie for him,' snapped
Clinton, 'and he knows it." [p.140]
0 In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan for aimless
hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]
0 Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a number of
them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was sure they had nothing to
hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely on the surface, never
produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny himself for five minutes, living in an apartment
secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182]

0 "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted hypothetical
about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, "He doesn't understand...that he's conceding the principles."
WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press and said that Moynihan knew what he
was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption about Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several examples
follow:
0 Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the Clintons, with
the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room...Their agenda was a delicate race between Hussein's
failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of
national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed
electrical grids, and so on. Hussein gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch, 170]
0 South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule was far more demanding than
ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden women." [Branch, 236] Later
Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast with a superficial American press, which portrayed
Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords
with whirlwind encouragements for citizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting
Bhutto corresponds to a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, "she [HRC] played the traditional role of
First Lady as wife and mother...") [Branch, 246]
0 China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she depicted the
"harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the rave reviews of HRC's speech.
[Branch, 289]
0 Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed from urgent political
tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact with her
throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs gratitude, but the
fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.

0 "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called Chelsea at
Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was another story. Jesse said he
knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in American politics. He did not know everything
involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now
above all, and if she needed to counsel, rage, or pray, he was always available." [Branch, 497]
Tension with Janet Reno
Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative opinion of
Janet Reno.
0 "He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney general. If he
removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall
to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's wholesale devotion to outside control for any
case in which the president himself may become a target...lf he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would
touch off a firestorm of protest like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the
Watergate scandal. That was not an option." [Branch, 388-389]
0 Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and continuing to
allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy. Branch then outlines a meeting
between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her "desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like
that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I
hired her to work for me." [Branch, 398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good
achievements including coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on
Whitewater, but that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno had failed to
defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension the entire executive
branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her more naive than upright, and the
fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch, 399] He cites that Clinton warned her that she should prepare
herself for not staying in the job for the entire second term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter
There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to North Korea
and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be on the front lines.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765941 Date: 07/31/2015
North Korea:
0 "On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore, and Clinton had
approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme isolation...Sure enough, Carter did reach North
Korean dictator Kim II-sung, who proposed to allow inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief
from the harsh economic sanctions. The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became
official, adding gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters, and he did not
believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt." [Branch, 162]
Haiti:
0 After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with Gore (who said
Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to Haiti to seek a truce with the
junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis' (arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus
what was in the United States' best interest). He didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North
Korea, Carter again, Carter went to the press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and
Carter, invited to stay over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the
next morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not right...The
press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent negotiators...He said the
current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that
Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with
restraint at their joint press conference, he allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he
had earned the right to speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the
United States government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-resident." [Branch,
200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
0 "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush. 'Dole will
support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he doesn't have much positive to
say." [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places where he is
briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the seemingly brutally candid
conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.

0 On page 92 Branch writes, "No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as alleged, but to
improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin." [Branch, 92]
0 In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also having Gore
substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other nations were offended that
Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to redeem himself and the administration for his
absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC "pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked.
So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to
take these exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and
were still wrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]
0 On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as a team to
secure the Cabinet for the second term.
0 Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second criminal
lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is about a leak of an offer
from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free. The exchange is more on ethics of the
offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
0 On Gore's announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his kickoff events—
once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were technical...But Gore got all the big
things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly
what he would do for them in the White House. The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third,
Gore would be badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, `if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post." [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues that
WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his campaign. "On tape, the president said he
confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must
project his platform—where he stood, precisely how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans
would try to knock him off substance." [Branch, 554]
0 WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not succeeding
him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart, experience, and motivated.
He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential character over detailed agendas for the
country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," but Clinton discounted this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would
wear well over time. Gore also was perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence,
which called for Gore to emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a
brooding quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature failed to
give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch, 599]

0 He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said the
president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had it not been for the vice
president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who would be a bright spot to run with,
perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though
she would never get chosen. How much of this was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is
unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be running essentially for a
third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would tarnish them with Clinton's
character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate that had been heard before—that Gore lacked
style and a light touch.
0 Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in one of their
stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he meant good on the policy,
and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend the two. Gore said he had to think about
it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the
message that Clinton must convey somehow without seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch, 623-624]
0 The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure at first
about recording the details. At the outset it says, "For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did he blame Clinton for his
defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him did." [Branch, 642] It has WJC
acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the White House. Then he says, "'I think you made a
mistake not to use me more in the last ten days," Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much
more upset about your message, now that we're being honest." [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought
bag saying that "Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an "unparalleled" vice president, but that
he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was "surreal."
o Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal had been
the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers
had tormented him now for four years. Gore said he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered
telling the president that he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for trouble. So he did
blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be
in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought he was in Neverland,' he said." [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported Clinton all through
the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated
that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened.
There was little to say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake. He

had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis. Well, he said, this is the first
time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed.
Their colliding perspectives made both of them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so
significant here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed honesty that
somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..." [Branch, 644-45]
Other
0 Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking Maggie to compile
confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. "Williams was shrewd, discreet, and efficient." [Branch, 161]
0 HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's suggestion to invade
Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the pressure, the lack of options, and his
sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign policy staff. He said she observed with some
suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake, Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed
the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray Inman as defense secretary." [Branch, 189]
0 ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book. Quinn said that
HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn. HRC said Feinman had withdrawn
from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be
about him and how it affected him as a ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor
that HRC and a female veterinarian of Socks' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House."
[Branch, 342-343]
0 Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had subpoenaed all
those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were there. This included "some two
dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed the subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]
0 Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, "In our glancing
associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as lighthearted or
recreational." [Branch, 495]
0 Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their best chance
to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, 'but I don't think Al would ever do it." [Branch, 540]

decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the two events are unconnected.
"When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He
could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..." [Branch, 557]
0 On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because "of hard intelligence
that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses the cancelled trip but does
not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.

Re: The Berlusconi assault
The physical attack on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is a major political event in Italy and
Europe. His assailant is a mentally disturbed man without a political agenda who has been in and out of
psychiatric care since he was 18 years old. Nonetheless, the assault has significant repercussions. It has
generated sympathy for Berlusconi as a victim—he has been obviously injured, lost two teeth and a pint
of blood, and doctors will keep him in the hospital for perhaps a week for observation. The attack comes
as Berlusconi was beginning to lose political footing, having lost his legal immunity. One court inquiry
is turning up evidence of his links to the Mafia while another is examining his role in the bribery case of
British lawyer David Mills. Berlusconi's government and party have used the attack as a way to turn the
sudden sympathy for him to his advantage, claiming that his opponents have sown a climate of ""hate."
Through demogogic appeals they are attempting to discredit and rebuff the legal proceedings against
him and undermine the investigative press. (Berlusconi is suing La Repu.bblica, the large independent
newspaper in Rome that has been most aggressive in digging into his affairs of all kind.)
It would seem proper and decent for the President to call Berlusconi to express his concern about his health
and wish him a speedy recovery, if he hasn't done so already. There are many reasons for Oba.ma to do
this, not least to condemn violence against a democratically elected head of state. It would be awkward
for the U.S. President not to call a Western head of state of a NATO country who has been physically
harmed. Berlusconi, for his part, would certainly make such a call public. It would therefore also be
awkward if a call were used only as an element in his sympathy campaign against the court proceedings.
If so, there is a larger message that should be communicated, perhaps by the President in his conversation,
but most importantly through a statement from the State Department, also conveyed by the U.S.
ambassador in Italy. The USG condemns any and all violence as an assault on democracy. By the same
measure, this incident involving an apparently deranged individual should not be exploited to raise

of law as well as to respect freedom of speech and the press.

Berlusconi 'cut deal with Mafia', court told
Former hitman claims Italian PM gave 'benefits' to the Mob for political support
By Michael Day in Milan
Saturday, 5 December 2009
The Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, made a deal with the Sicilian Mafia in the early 1990s that put the
country "in the hands" of the Mob, a court in Turin was told yesterday.
G-aspare Spatuzza, a jailed Mafia hitman turned witness, told a packed and heavily guarded bunker courtroom
that his Cosa Nostra Godfather boss had cut a deal with Mr Berlusconi in 1993 that provided unspecified
"benefits" to the Mafia in exchange for political support. The media tycoon entered. politics a few months later
and won his first term as Prime Minister in 1994.
Spatuzza said his boss, Giuseppe Graviano, who was jailed over Mafia bomb attacks in Rome, Milan and
Florence, had told him that the Mob had "got everything" with the help of Mr Berlusconi, adding that Graviano
called Mr Berlusconi "the man from Channel 5", in reference to his TV network.
The damaging claims came at the appeal hearing of Marcell° Dell'Utri, a key Berlusconi associate and senator,
who is challenging his nine-year jail sentence for links with the Mafia.
Spatuzza, in prison for several murders, testified: "Graviano told me the name of Berlusconi and said that
thanks to him and the man from our home town [an apparent reference to Dell' Utri] we have the country in our
hands." •
Mr Berlusconi has denounced the claims of Spatuzza as "vile", and "unfounded and defamatory", denying ever
having links with the Mafia. The Prime Minister's spokesman said the testimony yesterday was the Mafia's
"completely logical" revenge against the Prime Minister for his "determined" fight against organised crime.
Dell'Utri told the court that neither he nor Mr Berlusconi had Mafia connections. "It's in the interest of the
Mafia to force the collapse of the Berlusconi government because this government has done the most in the
fight against organised crime," he said. Mr Berlusconi, who recently lost his legal immunity to prosecution, was
said to have been furious this week, after the parliamentary Speaker, Gianfranco Fini, the man who is supposed
to be his closest ally, had said that the Spatuzza evidence was "an atomic bomb".
Mr Fini was recorded by an unobserved microphone while talking privately at an official dinner. Rumours of
the conservative Prime Minister's links with the Mob have persisted since investigators learnt that a Cosa Nostra
hitman, Vittorio Mangano, worked as Mr Berlusconi's "stable-master" at the media mogul's villa in Arcore
outside Milan in the 1970s. Much speculation has also centred on the origins of Mr Berlusconi's vast wealth.
Last week, the Prime Minister's broadcast group, Mediaset, and his holding company, Fininvest, announced it
intended to sue the left-wing newspaper La Repubblica over an article that said Mediaset was "20 per cent
owned by the Mafia".
La Stampa newspaper noted that the "dread combination of Mafia allegations and separation from his wife are
now his principal torments". Mr Berlusconi's estranged wife, Veronica Lario, is said to be seeking a f3m-a-
month divorce settlement, and a messy courtroom battle looms. Mr Berlusconi also faces a retrial on the charge
that he bribed the British lawyer David Mills to lie in court.

After a Court Ruling, Berlusconi's Legal Woes
Resume
By Jeff Israely
The world has spent the past six months wondering how — and with whom -- Silvio Berlusconi spends his
Saturday nights. But the combative, scandal-plagued Prime Minister of Italy would prefer to talk about his
mornings instead. "Do you know how I've been forced to spend my Saturday mornings since I entered politics?"
Berlusconi once declared to business leaders in Rome. "With my lawyers."
Italy's self-proclaimed Defendant in Chief makes a. point of lamenting all those weekends spoiled by stacks of
court dossiers. as further proof that he is the victim of politically motivated magistrates, whom he called during
the same speech "the spreading cancer of our democracy." LSee Berlusconi's worst vaffes.).
To combat such perceived persecution, Berlusconi has tested the bounds of decorous democratic conduct,
including his allies' pushing a bill through Parliament last year that gave him and other top Italian officeholders
immunity from prosecution. But since the Constitutional Court overturned that law in October, several criminal
investigations into Berlusconi's business dealings have been reopened, with other new charges rumored to be
looming.
The potentially most damaging trial is set to resume Friday, Dec. 4, in Milan, with the 73-year-old billionaire
being accused of paying British attorney David Mills $600,000 in 1997 to withhold incriminating evidence
about his broadcasting empire Mediaset. Mills is appealing a conviction in the same case; both men have denied
any wrongdoing.
So, alas, Berlusconi is back to spending his downtime with a well-paid cadre of more than a dozen avvocati,
who have been successful so far in keeping their biggest client clear of criminal convictions. Not that the
lawyers have ever really gone away. Since the media baron first ran for office 15 years ago, his legal advisers
have doubled as political consiglieri, key members of Parliament and even important Cabinet Ministers. Indeed,
while some critics have spoken of Berlusconi's reign as a kind of sultanate of showgirls or government by gaffe,
others have described it as a republic of attorneys. (See what Beriusconi's Obama "jok.es" sqy about Italy.)
His longtime lawyer Cesare Previti served as Italian Defense Minister during Beriusconi's first term in 1994
before being convicted of corruption himself (and losing twice on appeal). During Berlusconi's second term
(2001-06), Gaetano Pecorella, a former leftist, served as president of Parliament's Justice Commission, where
he was instrumental in shepherding through new laws that helped shield Berlusconi from investigating
magistrates.
Giovanni Sartori, a Columbia University professor of constitutional law, says the role Berlusconi's personal
lawyers have played in his legislative agenda is yet another gargantuan conflict of interest to add to those
related to his ownership of Italy's main private television stations. But by now, Sartori says, Berlusconi's
lawyers have perfected the art of exploiting Italy's painfully slow justice system: many cases conclude without a
final verdict because the statute of limitations has been reached. "It is more a mania than a necessity," Sartori
says of Berlusconi's near obsession in battling magistrates. "He feels persecuted, and fighting the judges is what
makes him happy."
Berlusconi's current point man is Nicol° Ghedini, a somber-faced, lanky 49-year-old criminal-defense attorney
from the northern city of Padua, who has served in both the Italian Senate and the lower house of Parliament.
Ghedini has continued to mount a grinding defense in the criminal cases, arguing in the Mills case that
Berlusconi cannot be present in the Milan courtroom for the next several months because of time conflicts with
his duties as Prime Minister. Ghedini has also spearheaded an increasingly aggressive legal strategy that has
included several libel suits against opposition newspapers. He declared in September that if necessary,
Berlusconi would testify in a suit against a journalist who referred to rumors that the Prime Minister is
impotent. Last week, Berlusconi vowed to launch additional suits against newspapers that printed
unsubstantiated reports that a close adviser of his was involved in a 1993 bombing campaign by the Sicilian
Mafia. (Read "An Offended Berlusconi Goes on the Offensive.")
Despite these many legal headaches, 'Berlusconi is embroiled in one other particularly thorny case that even he
can't blame on overzealous magistrates. Veronica Lario, Berlusconi's wife of more than. 20 years, filed for
divorce earlier this year, which sparked an avalanche of accusations that he frequented a prostitute from Bari

and an underage model from Naples. The Milan daily Corriere della Sera reported last week that Lario has
demanded 3.5 million euros ($5.2 million) in monthly payments, and Berlusconi countered with an offer of
300,000 euros ($450,000). No matter how this and the other cases shake out, there is little hope that Berlusconi
can avoid a mountain of lawyers' fees and some grim Saturdays that he'd rather devote to other business and
pleasures.

Good morning Roberta! Congratulations on a successful visit by the Secretary of State. We are looking forward to this
afternoon's teleconference. After opening remarks, Minister Cannon will ask Prime Minister Bellerive to speak and the UN
(we may only have DPKO LeRoy on line due to visit of Sec Gen to Haiti). He will then ask FM Amorim and Sec State
Clinton to provide their views on the situation and then open the floor to Kouchner and others. Response has been good
and most will be represented at FM level (Mexico/Espinosa may still be in flight from Japan, and Argentina and Costa
Rica will be Vice-Ministers).
There is as well agreement in principle to begin laying the groundwork for a broader Donors Conference on
Reconstruction and our offer to host a preparatory meeting on January 25th has been well received. However, early
indications are that the EU has a conflict as they have their General Relations and Foreign Relations meetings scheduled
for that day. As the EU would be essential for such a meeting we are scrambling to look for alternative dates. Given the

"The Next Six Months - Work Plan","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766082 Date: 08/31/2015
RELEASE IN FULL
Sensitive But Unclassified
To: The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of State
Thru: Cheryl Mills, Counselor and Chief of Staff
From: Reta Jo Lewis, Special Representative, Global Intergovernmental Affairs
Date: December 31, 2009
Subject: The Next Six Months - Work Plan
I. Introduction
The next six months will be a critical time for establishing the Department's leadership in
bridging relationships for U.S. intergovernmental officials and their foreign counterparts,
defining the mission and role of the Office of the Special Representative for Global
Intergovernmental Affairs (""S/SRGIA"), and outlining an agenda that serves the needs of the
Department and these officials. Our approach will be strategic and integrated, working in
collaboration with Department bureaus and USAID offices to strengthen and deliver on the
Secretary's and Administration's priorities.
II. Key Objectives
The Special Representative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs will serve the global
needs of the U.S. intergovernmental officials and the entities they represent. The S/SRGIA will
also connect U.S. state and local officials with intergovernmental officials around the world,
promote local capacity building investments and programs to enhance country-led processes, and
facilitate the needs and goals of intergovernmental officials here and abroad consistent with
Department priorities.
III. Next Steps
This work plan describes activities that the S/SRGIA plans to initiate, grow and
implement in the next six months. To place the Work Plan in context, we describe below
S/SRGIA' s work-planning process.
A. Establish S/SRGIA Mission and Role in the Department.
Currently, no one and no office in the State Department has accountability to serve the
needs of intergovernmental officials, (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected leaders, the entities
that represent them) with respect to their global affairs portfolios. State and local officials'
concerns are typically routed on an individual basis through bureaus with the results reflecting ,
the priority of the person in the bureau's estimation or the nature of the request. Priority
activities will be as follows:
1
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766082 Date: 08/31/2015

Sensitive But Unclassified
• Confirm the Secretary's support to focus on priority issues and countries;
• Join Department's meetings and conversations with visiting foreign state and local
representatives and dignitaries to establish S/SRGIA's role;
• Strengthen support on global intergovernmental affairs issues internally in the State
Department, by explaining the value of these stakeholders;
• Track deployment of resources assisting intergovernmental officials and leverage the
State Department's collective U.S. and global intergovernmental relationships;
• Follow and interpret international issues (e.g., food security, global health, climate
change, trade and economic development, energy) of importance to state governments;
• Promote dialogue between the Department (e.g., USAID, EEB, ECA, Public Private
Partnerships, Global Women's Issues, Consular Affairs, MCC and targeted Regional
Bureaus) and external constituents (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected officials, and
the entities that they represent) for more effective partnerships and relationships; and
• Collaborate with the Public Diplomacy and INR to create a survey of foreign
intergovernmental affairs officials to determine their needs and engage U.S.
intergovernmental officials to learn how the Department should help to further their
global goals.
B. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of
U.S. intergovernmental officials.
State economies are increasingly globalized, and more and more U.S. companies are
competing in international markets and against firms worldwide. As the principal stewards of
their states' economic success, Governors recognize that the global marketplace presents both
challenges and opportunities and that states must address both to ensure their continued
competitiveness. Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach
activities in partnership with its participating US and other intergovernmental and international
organizations. U.S. national organizations who serve governmental authorities include but are
not limited to the following:
• National Governors Association;
• National Lt. Governors Association;
• U.S. Conference of Mayors;
• National League of Cities;
• National Association of Counties/Large Urban County Caucus;
• National Association of States Attorney Generals;
• National State Legislatures; and
• Councils of State Governments.
Outreach is essential to many aspects of the Department's activities. S/SRGIA's outreach
objective is to promote and increase the general awareness of the benefits of the State
Department efforts in global intergovernmental affairs, especially among decision makers and
policy makers, educational entities, non-governmental organizations, public-interest groups and
public agencies. S/SRGIA will provide international outreach services to state and local elected
officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and all other inhabited U.S.
territories. Specific objectives are to:

• Build state by state profiles, thus creating a set of priorities and identifying opportunities
for collaboration with state and local officials on their global projects and Department
priorities;
• Establish our target list of public officials to assist and nurture relationships with
principals and the organizations that represent them and their global needs;
• Create dialogue with the Governors and Mayors in preparation for the NGA and Mayors
Washington conferences in the fall;
• Travel to conferences and meetings within the United States and countries abroad
required to implement the Department's global intergovernmental affairs agenda;
• Develop a network of leaders, to collaborate and create partnerships;
• Coordinate meetings between Department of State experts and state and local officials;
• Support targeted elected officials trade missions and other official trips abroad;
• Develop a strategy for deliverables such as multilateral pacts and Memorandum of
Understandings on key State Department priorities that we will sign with responsible
parties; and
• Collaboration with EEB, to partner with them to engage state and local government
leaders in the bureaus enhanced commercial diplomacy efforts (e.g. the Administration's
National Export Initiative and EEB/Consular Affairs Business Visa Facilitation initiative,
etc.).
C. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of
middle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials.
Currently, ECA conducts a significant number of exchanges with foreign and
domestic government officials. None of ECA's programs target regions with the
objective of enhancing another country's government systems because the bureau's
authorities do not permit any type of training since everything must be done under the
auspices of enhancing mutual understanding. The most visible ECA program is the
International Visitor Leadership Program which in FY09 brought in 1,390 foreign
government officials at the state, city and national levels to gain knowledge around the
US political system and culture. To date, the bureau estimates the same number of
government visitors in FY10.
Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities in
partnership with international organizations. International organizations who serve local
governmental authorities include but are not limited to the following:
• United Cities and Local Governments;
• Metropolis;
• The World Urban Forum;
• UN-HABITAT;
• Latin American and Caribbean Ministers of Housing and Urbanization;
• UN Advisory Committee of Local Authorities;
• The World Mayors Council on Climate Change;

• Sister Cities International;
• Local Governments for Sustainability; and
• Municipal Development Partnerships which targets governments in Africa.
Priority activities will be as follows:
• S/SRGIA will collaborate with Public Diplomacy to conduct stakeholder outreach
with strategic countries — e.g. Af, Pak, Iraq — and key emerging powers (Brazil,
India, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria) and developing countries (Rwanda,
Ethiopia, Kenya, etc.) to obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of middle
and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials;
• Collaborate with [NR to assist us in gaining a better understanding of what
foreign intergovernmental affairs officials want to engage with their US
counterparts ranging from engagement on a host of common policy concerns,
opportunities, programs and connections.
D. Provide Leadership for Department Intergovernmental Capacity Building.
One of our largest challenges in most developing countries is the lack of capacity in the
government below the President and Prime Minister level. As the Department seeks to
implement development programs or conduct diplomacy, there is often limited local counterpart
capacity to do so with or to empower. S/SRGIA will work with USAID and State bureaus and
offices to provide connections and leadership development to build the capacity of
intergovernmental officials in countries around the world. Currently, millions of dollars of
USAID and ECA grants that support capacity building are typically carried out by contractors
and have results that are not transparent in their reporting or impact. S/SRGIA will partner with
existing offices to provide leadership for the investment in this space, accountability for the
outcomes and programming, and foster relationships between intergovernmental officials here in
the US with foreign partners to mentor and model what is needed.
S/SRGIA capacity building strategies will primarily be based on best practices derived
from studying successful and less-successful approaches. Within the next six months, S/SRGIA
will work in partnership with Department and USAID bureaus and resources. Priority activities
will be as follows:
• Identify State Department investments, canvass additional State Department dedicated
resources other than grant-making and assess the strength of the current environment
needed to advance the S/SRGIA's Secretary capacity building agenda for state and local
leaders; participate in QDDR process regarding this agenda;
• Develop an agenda for a high-level retreat on the formulation of a National Capacity
Development Strategy to present achievements to date, lessons learned and proposals for
institutional capacity development going forward;
• Work with the Chiefs of Missions and other diplomats in countries where capacity
building is critical to the success of our diplomacy and development efforts;

• Amplify and sustain high quality and results driven support to institutional capacity
development by assisting in advocating for increased funding and building public-private
partnerships;
• Prioritize discrete initiatives to "fast track", based on importance, regional priorities (e.g.,
Asia, Africa and Latin America), assessment of readiness, impact and feasibility and
translate priorities into actionable interventions;
• Develop a network of experts involved in existing capacity-building initiatives related to
global intergovernmental affairs and build partnerships;
• Define a coordinated approach and institutional responsibilities for supporting the GIA
capacity building initiative; and
• Identify opportunities for further collaboration with state and local officials on their
projects and Department priorities.
IV. Administrative Activities
• Standardize requests for assistance with projects related to policy, business, trade,
consular affairs, etc.; and
• Link the Department website to states websites and trade and development office
websites.
V. Budget and Staffing
S/SRGIA will require a budget and staffing to fulfill its mission.
VI. Assessment of Progress
The short term goal will be to engage U.S. intergovernmental officials about their global
concerns. The S/SRGIA office will become a significant resource for high-level State
Department engagement for U.S. state and local elected officials. The benefits of this new office
will be immediate and grow over time as our engagement deepens. Assisting US states and local
governments to expand their exports, promote locations for foreign investment and for
participation in State Department priorities are some of the short term benefits we hope to
achieve with respect to U.S. intergovernmental officials.
With respect to the global intergovernmental officials, in the short term, we expect to
work with our Regional Bureaus and Offices, (e.g., USAID, ECA, EEB, etc.) to assess the
current state of play and assist us with how we better target and leverage our assistance to this
constituency.
In the longer term, institutionally, we need to sustain relationships with our embassies
and missions overseas, so that they can assist state and local officials and their constituencies to
expand their global business base. As related to our national capacity building strategy, in the
long term, we seek to empower and educate and build relationships with state and local officials
abroad. We also seek accountability for the outcomes of the programming and will provide
leadership for future investments. Going forward, we will tailor these investments to address
regional State Department priorities.

In addition, since there is a lack of USG harmonization of all of the relevant USG
programs, having S/SRGIA be the designated coordinator will allow DOS to take the lead in
synchronizing government wide programs that engage foreign government officials. This will be
another long term goal for the office.
VII. Potential Events
A. Potential Events and Activities for S
1. Private Dinner or Luncheon with the Governors and Urban Mayors;
2. Roundtable or Speech at USCMNGA Winter Meetings; and

Dear Hillary,
You will remember our initiative to bring the most senior retired generals from the Chinese and US militaries. With
these 10 generals from the two countires, I am going to be in DC on October 21 and 22. these Generals have been part
our of our Sanya Initiative - the unofficial mil-mil dialogue I started last year. It'll be me, Joe Prueher, Charley Wilhelm,
Ron Fogleman, and Denny Reimer. The Chinese will be led by General Xiong Guangkai and include four other very senior
and respected Generals from the PLA.
The Chinese view this as a formal track one program and take it very seriously. We will meet with ADM Mullen and ADM
Keating in Honolulu and see GEN Cartwright at the Pentagon. It would be a terrific sign of the U.S.'s support for this
relationship if you were able join or host (I'd be pleased to fund) a very private dinner on the evening of the 21 or the
22nd of October. Just you, the Generals, and interpreters - perhaps the Chinese Ambassador if you think that would be
valuable.

Cheryl, Meghann,
Below is some intel David got on the Mexico conference David picked up from the Mexicans here. The conference's
timing would be extremely awkward if things proceed as Guy Noel suggests:
Guy reports that ""they" have decided to go forward with:
1)October 29th Interpellation (Impeachment) of the PM
2) Oct. 31St the president will add the ratification of the new PM on the existing list of the LOWER HOUSE activities
(which Guy asserts is illegal)
3) November 3rd Nomination of the new PM
4) Then the ratification of the PM
You can bet that the PM will repeat all this verbatim to George Soros when she sees him today. Not sure what - if
anything - that will provoke.
got this information too and has a pre-scheduled meeting with Preval today. I understand he plans on
raising this. We'll let you know what we hear.
In my Tuesday lunch with Gabriel I mentioned in very clear terms our concern about any sort of turmoil in government
reflecting very badly on the international community's efforts to tout Haiti as stable and open for investment. He said
he understood. He said, "I don't see Michelle (Pierre-Louis) going anywhere soon." He conceded that while Preval did
have a majority in Parliament, he could not control all parliamentarians on all issues.
We'll try and get in to see someone from the Senate in the coming days.
This is why a call would be most useful.

international community's engagement with Haiti (both political and assistance), but that it has morphed into a donor's
meeting to discuss coordination of assistance. Originally they planned to invite Foreign Ministers, but now they are
inviting the heads of assistance agencies. Preval was originally to attend, but he has decided to send his Foreign
Minister and the Minister of Planning. Romero indicated that the GOM has not received the number and caliber of
confirmations of attendance that they had hoped for. I asked Romero what outcome the GOM would like to see from
the meeting, and he said that they want to encourage donors to coordinate more with the GOH and among themselves.
The GOM hosted an "experts" meeting on Haiti two weeks ago where a number of individuals long involved in Haiti
presented position papers on the political, economic and assistance challenges in Haiti. He said that a common theme
of the papers was the need for greater donor coordination. He will send me a set of the position papers. Mexico is not a
donor to Haiti.

Subject: Lugar Remarks tonight
Speech of Senator Lugar
Foreign Assistance and Development in a New Era
Thursday, January 28, 2010
U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar will deliver the following speech tonight at the Society for International Development's annual
dinner.
I thank the Society for International Development, its members and its leadership - Betsy Bassan and Joe Feuer - for
the work they do on development issues around the world, and for organizing this annual gala. It is unfortunate that
Chairman Kerry could not be with us tonight, but I know he shares my gratitude for your recognition.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Shah for his remarks and to recognize the efforts of USAID and its
new Administrator in responding to the tragic earthquake in Haiti. Dr. Shah has faced one of the most challenging
crises imaginable only five days after being sworn in. The job ahead of him - in Haiti and around the globe - is
monumental. I look forward to supporting his work and that of his agency in the coming years. I commend all of our
responders from all government agencies for their courage, compassion, and skill as they continue their mission in
Haiti, and I join all of you in extending our prayers to the people of that nation.
Tonight I would like to offer a few points about where we have come from and where we might be going with regard
to U.S. investments in development.
The challenges of global poverty and hunger are growing at a time when worries about the sustainability of natural
resources are increasing. Population growth and increased affluence in some parts of the globe will require that we
more than double world food production by 2050 to keep pace. At the same time, to address environmental concerns,
we will have to harvest that food from roughly the same amount of land that is in production today. The accessibility
and availability of food deeply affects the health of populations. Childhood malnutrition has lifelong consequences for
the productivity of individuals and nations. Poverty denies opportunity to the world's young people and breeds
extremism and instability that spills over borders. It is not surprising that the CIA has long tracked and analyzed
global food supplies as an indicator of potential conflict.
There is probably not a person in this room who would disagree that development is critical for U.S. national security
and that the alleviation of poverty and hunger is a key component. This is a sentiment that is shared in most parts of
our government, including the Department of Defense.
But even though the importance of advancing development goals is evident, constructing the most efficient,
accountable, and transparent means for achieving those goals is complex and challenging. Differences of opinion exist
with regard to who should be performing development functions and how these activities should be integrated into our
broader foreign policy efforts. We have not reached a consensus within our government on who should be doing what,
where, when and why.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766534 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766534 Date: 08/31/2015
As we debate these issues, we should keep in mind that diplomacy and development are two distinct disciplines.
Although diplomacy and development often can be mutually reinforcing, at their core, they have different priorities,
resource requirements, and time horizons. Most obviously, diplomacy is far more concerned with solving immediate
problems, usually associated with countries of strategic interest. Although we hope that our development efforts will
sometimes yield short-term strategic benefits, that is not their primary purpose. In a development context, we are
willing to take a much longer view of the world and devote resources to countries of less, or even minimal, strategic
significance. We are willing to allow the diplomatic and national security benefits of development work to accrue over
time. And we are willing to engage in missions for purely altruistic reasons. These differences underscore why
development must be an independent partner of diplomacy, not merely its servant.
Reforming U.S. Foreign Assistance
Reforming U.S. foreign assistance - in both substance and architecture - has been a priority for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. Secretary Clinton has stated: ""I want USAID to be seen as the premier development agency in
the world." I share that sentiment. One of the basic questions with respect to foreign aid reform is how we can best
strengthen the capacity of USAID to run effective assistance programs. During the last two decades, decision-makers
have not made it easy for the agency to perform its mission. Development resources declined precipitously in the
1990s and reorganization initiatives resulted in the agency's loss of evaluation, budget, and policy capacity. There is
broad consensus among development experts that the loss of these functions at USAID is inhibiting the success of our
development programs. Our development efforts will never be as effective as they should be if the agency that houses
most of our development expertise is cut out of relevant policy and budget decisions.
Events since 2001 have spurred greater investments in foreign assistance. But many of these resources have been
located outside of USAID. Roughly two dozen departments and agencies have taken over some aspects of foreign
assistance, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Agriculture.
The President has advocated doubling foreign assistance over time, and has announced new initiatives on food
security and health. Given the increased resources needed for these initiatives, it is crucial that the American people
and Congress have confidence that these funds will be used efficiently.
USAID must have a central role in development policy decisions. If we are to avoid inefficient experimentation, it must
have the capacity to evaluate programs and disseminate information about best practices and methods. That requires
policy makers to continue augmenting the agency's staffing and expertise. These principals are reflected in legislation
that Senator Kerry and I introduced last year, S. 1524, the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act.
The Administration has initiated two separate studies - the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review and the National Security Council's Presidential Study Directive on Development - in an attempt
to make recommendations on how development programs can better support U.S. foreign policy objectives. The
QDDR will not be completed until this fall and it is uncertain when, or if, we will know the outcomes of the PSD.
I am eager to review the Administration's ideas when they are ready. But in the meantime, Congress should be
offering its own ideas on how to improve our government's development capacity. The Kerry-Lugar foreign assistance
reform bill is the product of well over a year of research and analysis by Senators and their staffs. It has strong
support in the aid community. And it is co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 23 Senators, twelve of whom are
members of the Foreign Relations Committee. This level of backing for a bill related to foreign assistance is extremely
rare. It provides an opportunity to build something approaching a consensus on this issue. I am hopeful that the
Executive Branch will recognize that a bill co-sponsored by a majority of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
nearly a quarter of the full Senate should be given substantial weight in its review process. A strong development
agency that serves under the foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State, as envisioned in our bill, will best
empower her to advance U.S. goals.
A Development Policy Guided by Objectives
Even as we reconsider our development architecture, it is vital that development policy is guided by objectives rather
than by how we organize our government to deliver development assistance. We should focus on the big issues - food
scarcity, poverty, disease, environmental degradation -- that prevent economic growth in a large swath of the world's
countries. Those objectives require that strategies reflect the needs of the countries we are helping rather than the
vagaries of our own budget process, which often allocates funds in response to lobbying pressures, media interest, or
political favoritism. Country strategies based on broad objectives also give us the best chance to avoid dependence on
arbitrary spending targets for specific sectors. For example, promoting food security requires investments not just in
agricultural productivity, but in clean water, infrastructure, basic and higher education, and land titling, to name just a
few factors.
The Global Food Security Act, which I authored with Senator Casey and which Senator Kerry has co-sponsored,
reflects these principles. The food price crisis that occurred in 2008 resulted from a culmination of policy choices by
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766534 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766534 Date: 08/31/2015
donor and recipient governments over a decades-long period. That crisis was a wakeup call for the development
community, for international donors, and for policymakers worldwide. Because achieving food security must be a
multi-sector endeavor that goes beyond simply raising crop yields, U.S. policy must seek to integrate a variety of
approaches and actors. At the same time, we do not want to delegate responsibility for food security policy to multiple
departments. That could further weaken our already fractured foreign assistance structure. That is why our bill
designates USAID, which has the broad development experience necessary, as the lead agency to implement the
strategy.
"Whole-of-Government" in Perspective
The term "whole-of-government" has come into vogue in policy circles. To the extent that the term underscores the
complexity of development problems and the need to apply the talents of a diverse set of agencies to their solution, it
is useful and descriptive. Our government must have the capacity to draw on expertise to achieve vital development
missions without artificial barriers erected by agencies. Many agencies are working together successfully on
development problems in many parts of the world.
But we should not mistake the term "whole-of-government" for an organizational strategy. Even if multiple agencies
are making contributions, someone must be in charge, someone must coordinate the activities of all involved, and
someone must take responsibility for inefficiencies and failures.
This is especially important in a development context because of our highly fragmented aid system. The risk is that
the term "whole-of-government," will be used to justify that fragmentation or preserve roles for agencies where they
are not justified. We also must be careful that the whole-of-government concept does not re-define development as a
series of technical decisions - from where to dig wells to which seeds to plant in which soils. Such a redefinition would
devalue the discipline of development, which many practitioners have spent a lifetime studying and testing. We know
from long experience that technical expertise must be grounded in an understanding of development. For example,
agricultural advancement depends as much or more on reaching women farmers, building agriculture education, and
engaging civil society in support of rural development than it does on seed quality and planting decisions. An
integrated strategy can only come from an agency that understands development is a separate discipline, as Dr. Shah
has said.
I believe the starting point for any future design of our assistance programs should not be the status quo, but rather
the period in which we had a well-functioning and well-resourced aid agency. Even if we emphasize the talents of
multiple agencies, a strong aid agency that can design integrated country-specific strategies is a key to success.
Unity of Purpose
Instead of accepting whole-of-government, or any other organizational model, as the guiding narrative, I believe
there is a more helpful way of viewing the development mission - that is "unity-of-purpose." We need to be unified
around common purposes for which we can marshal the appropriate level of resources and variety of approaches.
There will be situations that call for the involvement of multiple agencies under the direction of one government
entity. But, the decision to involve other government actors should be driven by the purpose. Such is clearly the case
now in Haiti. The U.S. government and international actors are unified for the purpose of disaster response. That
response involves the coordination of hundreds of organizations to rescue people and to provide basic elements
needed for survival. At some point soon, the mission will evolve from disaster response to reconstruction to
development. We should be asking whether we will be able to maintain a unity-of-purpose even as that purpose
changes.
The Lugar-Casey bill proposes that there be a unity-of-purpose around achieving global food security. Regardless of
the situation, it is the unity-of-purpose that should guide how foreign assistance is designed. I applaud Secretary
Clinton for adopting food security as a top priority. Her inter-agency team has been working diligently on its Global
Food Security and Hunger Initiative, and Congress has been responsive in appropriating funding. Many operational
decisions have yet to be made, particularly decisions relating to coordination, but I stand ready to work with the
Administration to pass the Lugar-Casey bill as soon as possible. I look forward to achieving a unity-of-purpose
between Congress and the Administration on food security.
These are not easy issues to solve. I applaud all of you here tonight for your dedication to development and your
willingness to work with Congress and the Administration as we try to rebuild our assistance infrastructure. I would
conclude with a quote from Dr. Norman Borlaug, the Nobel Laureate and Father of the Green Revolution, whose
optimism never flagged. He believed that constant striving would eventually wear down all obstacles. He said, "I
cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that further progress depends on intelligent, integrated and persistent effort
by government leaders, statesmen, tradesmen, scientists, educators and communication agencies." That is as true
today as when he said it 39 years ago, and I invite everyone here to make their own contributions in that spirit.

Madam Secretary,
That would be more than fine. I appreciate you even looking to see if this may work.
On another note I wanted to send congratulations to you on the announcement of your daughters engagement. I know
you are proud of her and rightfully so.
Also I had dinner last night with a mutual friend of ours, Sen Lindsay Graham. Lindsay always talks how much he likes
you and said if I were to be in contact with you to say hi from him.
Stay well and I look forward to hearing and seeing you soon.
All my best,

I hope you, the President and Chelsea had a great Thanksgiving. Hopefully things will wind down and you'll be able to
spend some time with your family. As you know, I'm being honored by the American Friends of the Hebrew University
on Thursday, March 11, 2010. I'd be so honored if you would consider being the keynote speaker. I've had some

I look forward to seeing you soon.

H: Steve Clemons called me last night to talk about this, which he's just posted on his website. Ed Luce of the FT of
course told him. Also, Clemons had dinner this week with Petraeus, who freely talked about running for president. Sid
John Podesta on Obama team. I am hearing that Financial Times Washington Bureau Chief Edward Luca has a pretty
significant interview with Center for American Progress President and former White House Chief of Staff Jahn ?od.esta
coming out on Monday. Luce recently did a video intervjew 'with Senator john,Mc
fCain. One source tells me that Podesta
""goes farther" in his critique of the Obama team than his already pretty direct comments in Luce's recent survey of the
Obama White House's inner workings.

Clemons posted this piece on his dinner with Petraeus, (it's replete with a lot of punditry), but he told me more detail about
his attitude and interest. Among other things, Petraeus recounted a joke about Gates' speech at the Alfalfa Club dinner
that Petraeus couldn't be there because he was in Iowa. Petraeus didn't tell that story to disdain the possibility. He smiled
and watched closely for reaction from others. S

I recently had the opportunity to participate in a small dinner with CENTCOM Commander .
General David Petraeus and his wife Holly. These sorts of discussions are nearly always off the record -- but the fact that
they happened is not off limits.
Petraeus was not in uniform but rather wore what looked to me to be a brand new, perfectly tailored dark suit. I joked to
him that if I Twilt.-
-s
,rgc, that out of two dozen or so times I had seen Petraeus that this was the first time I'd seen him out of
uniform, an ice cold shudder of fear would spread quickly through some political circles in DC.
In August of 2007, I wroteoiece, stating that folks should keep an eye out for the possibility that General Petraeus might
run for President in 2012. In April 2008, Steven Lee Myers wrote a solid New York Times follow up titled "The
General" referencing my earlier take.
Recently, legendary newsman Ai:nai4d de 13orchgave resuscitated the topic of an Eisenhoweresque future for the
counterinsurgency guru in his piece, "President ?etraeus7"
Petraeus was recently named as one of Foreign Policy magazine's tip 100 ttzal thinkers, and as U.S. News & World
Reports "Washington Whispers" notes, he is going to be speaking in May 2010 at the annual American Enterprise
Institute dinner receiving the Irving Kristol Award.
In January 2010, Public Policy Pollin.q revealed that while Obama held a ten point lead over a potential wild card race
against Petraeus, the General had some strengths. But the pollsters also noted that many in the American public just
didn't know enough yet about Petraeus to form an opinion:
Finally our blog readers voted for David Petraeus as our wild card Republican this month and his
numbers come out as a mixed bag. He has the largest deficit against Obama, trailing 44-34. But at +13
his net favorability is better than the President or any of the other Republicans we tested. The problem for

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767171 Date: 08/31/2015
him is that the numbers break down 25/12- 63% of voters in the country don't know enough about him to
have formed an opinion. Who knows if Petraeus would actually have any interest in going into politics, but
if he did he would be introducing himself to many voters for the first time.
President Obama himself, according to what some of his aides have reported to me, is quite taken with David Petraeus
and respects his approach and thinking.
Petraeus has also been respectful of the President -- although when pushed at a recent forum about how he might react
to a Presidential decision on Afghanistan that the General might not have liked, Petraeus offered a cryptic rather than
clear response. (see above video)
At the "First Draft of History" meeting sponsored by the Atlantic Monthly/Atlantic Media Group, the Newseum, and the
Aspen Institute; Petraeus when asked if he would support the President no matter what the result of the strategic review
on Afghanistan responded that he "would continue to give the President the best professional military advice he could."
Contrast that with Defense Secretary Robert Gates resoonOinato_the..saest.ipr
.j., "We will salute and execute [the
President's] decisions faithfully and to the best of our ability."
But after spending an evening with General Petraeus and watching him closely for a number of years, there is no way that
this intelligent leader -- with whom I have some disagreements but respect -- could be comfortable with the Tea Party
takeover of the Republican political machine.
There is always the possibility that a core of reasonable Republicans like Michael Bloomberg, James Baker, Olympia
Snowe, Chuck Hegel, Alan Simpson, John Whitehead, Peter Peterson, Rita Hauser and others will try to rekindle classic
Republican sensibilities by fighting to re-hijack their party back in an Eisenhower-like campaign with Petraeus at the lead.
Remember that Eisenhower clinched the Republican nomination by promising to be the President who though he knew
war would end the Korean War. Petraeus knows Afghanistan and Iraq -- and though it seems hard to envision today could
be the kind of leader promising to end those wars if Obama proves unable to do so.
But there is another option that intrigues me and seems more realistic than imagining the iconic David Petraeus running
for President -- and that is his running for Vice President.
I think Vice President Joe Biden has done an outstanding job and of all the big guns in the Obama White House, Biden
has done the best job of outperforming expectations. He had given President Obama much needed counsel, not always
taken regrettably, but counsel that Obama needed to show the American public he was getting. Biden has been the key
agent behind the scenes in moving Iraq's elections forward. He has scored a lot of wins -- not reported -- in the
nuclear/WMD controls arena. Biden has worked with Gates in stabilizing an awkward and complex relationship with
Russia -- and his counterpoints on the Afghanistan surge, in my view, remain compelling.
But Biden is going to have to find a way to hold his spot in 2012 because others are going to be gunning for it.
As I look at it now, Hillary Clinton who has now said that she will not do more than one term as Secretary of State would
be a natural candidate for the Obama VP slot. Her franchise is not completely in the control of the Obama team yet, but
moving Hillary closer to the White House (although her private home on Whitehaven Street is actually a couple of hundred
feet closer to the White House than the VP residence at the Naval Observatory) would finalize Obarna's takeover of all the
key political franchises in the Democratic Party -- starting with Daley's machine, Deschle's machine, Kennedy's machine,
Edwards' machine, and then the Clintons'.
But General David Petraeus, in his business suit, lurks out there. Obama seems to be concerned about looking like he is
weak on national security. The Republicans -- at Cheney's constant goading (and now Sarah Palin's) -- seem to want to
continue to play politics through fear-mongering.
Obama could neutralize the possibility that he faces a Republican party challenge by David Petraeus by inviting the
General on to the 2012 ticket as a Democrat.
Crazy? Perhaps.
But inviting potential rivals into his tent is becoming a standard Obama trademark -- much as he did by appointing
Republican Governor of Utah and former G.W. Bush administration Deputy US Trade Representative Jon Huntsman, Jr.
to serve as US Ambassador to the People's Republic of China.
And get this, we have just learned that David Petraeus has not voted since 2002 -- not because he doesn't care to vote --
but reportedly because he wants to keep his eventual political options and political loyalties open.
This is a soldier for whom all options are on the table and who is keeping his powder dry.
My hunch is that whether Obama sticks with Vice President Biden or pivots to someone else, Petraeus will be on the short
list of those considered.

Re: Iran, Saudi
Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting conversation on Iran
and Saudi Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now director of the Nabucco pipeline project.)
On Iran, harsh, targeted sanctions are absolutely necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always
coupled with an offer to negotiate. The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives:
According to Fischer's intelligence, Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The
regime has splits at the top. Perhaps true, perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside sanctions
puts additional pressure on internal divisions, whatever they are. Extending an open hand while brandishing a
stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver for Iran: Its refusal to accept the open hand justifies
application of the stick. Even when sanctions are enforced it always remains useful to say another way is open.
The damage done to Iran is therefore the result of its own choice. This approach also aids the opposition. A
purely condign sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and tighten repression. Talking
of regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the regime. The opposition is
a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political and moral level. Pushed to the
wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might involve thousands or tens of thousands of political
killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have
their own bomb. The Saudis invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their
bomb in reserve.

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767361 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767361 Date: 08/31/2015
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
"yet another very good Friday".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. "We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it," she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
"We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence."
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on," Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767362 Date: 08/31/2015
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
"yet another very good Friday".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two

Robinson and McG have confirmed to speak with you.
In his remarks, Brown indicated that you would host an investment conference this spring. Declan believes this is much
too soon. We might try to steer it to you meeting with Robinson and McG this spring — ie in a few weeks time -- with an
eye toward an investment conference once it is well prepared.
I think we are okay waiting an hour to do the statement, but we'll work to get excerpts out. Kamala announced that you

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.ukithe-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
"yet another very good Friday".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. "We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it," she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.

Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
"We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence."
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on," Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
"We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence."
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on," Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal —finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it.

Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
"yet another very good Friday".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. "We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it," she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.

changed their minds.
"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on," Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Re: Distant early warning signs
You should read this. This piece is prominently featured today in the Telegraph. It is a Tory paper. But it
reflects more or less the current conventional wisdom in the UK. Of course, it's much worse in France.
Sarkozy's unleashed id is the barometer. You are still perceived as separate and even increasingly as
compensatory. The more coverage of your NI role, the better, if it can be done. (Let me discuss with Shaun on a
strategy on how to brief.) The China/Google stand was critical. What can be done in Middle East, esp Syria,
push back against Avigdor Lieberman's recent unpleasant noises, with new US ambo going? Just a thought.
And: the attitude that the president's cancellation of attendance at US-EU summit is simply a merited position is
self-defeating. First, the Europeans learned from the press, not through diplomatic channels beforehand, treated
as second class. Second, of course the EU is what it is, esp after the new nonentities named at its head at Merkel
and Sarko's behest. But to dismiss the EU because of that is smug and complacent. If the EU has no agenda, it's
really up to the US, as it was for 50 years before. It's up to the US to organize around a new agenda on the crisis
of global economy, including a common approach to China's mercantilism and climate change, etc, nuclear
proliferation, etc. Otherwise, petty trade wars will begin to dominate US-EU relations.

They swooned when the candidate took his stump skills to Berlin, where he spoke of ""the burdens of global
citizenship" and promised to "remake the world".
He had lived in Indonesia as a boy, travelled to Pakistan and Africa in his youth and came from a family that
looked, as he liked to quip, "like the United Nations". Then, in his first year in office, he made 10 trips abroad to
21 countries, making him the most travelled of all United States presidents in their first 12 months.
So it came as a rude shock to Europeans last week when Obama decided not to bother with the European Union
knees up Madrid in May - particularly miffing Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero of Spain, who, like the
American president, campaigned on his opposition to the Iraq war.
American officials intimated that they were unimpressed by European bickering over who would sit next to the
Obamas at the summit dinner and even over who would be the first leader to shake the hand of the person that
Oprah Winfrey anointed as "the One" in Iowa back in 2008.
Perhaps Obama himself was a touch irritated by Nicolas Sarkozy's new habit of mocking him. "Obama has been
in power for a year, and he has already lost three special elections," the French president said last week. "Me, I
have won two legislative elections and the EU election. What can one say I've lost?"
The discomfort of Europe's elites indicates growing a realisation that perhaps he's just not that into them. The
fact that Hillary Clinton, Obama's Secretary of State, felt the need to point out that "European security remains
an anchor of US foreign and security policy" spoke volumes.
There is little sign that Obama feels the kind of instinctive belief in transatlantic alliances that, for instance,
President George W Bush felt. In Washington, the much-ballyhooed "special relationship" - a phrase that Team
Obama views as betraying a British inferiority complex and cloying neediness - has never felt less special.
That's partly because Gordon Brown is viewed as so toxic by the Obama administration that dealings with
Downing Street are in a state of virtual suspended animation. But there are no indications yet that a Prime
Minister David Cameron will have the red carpet rolled out for him.
One of Obama's conceits was that he would be the "Pacific president", looking west from his native Hawaii to
China, India and Japan rather than east to America's traditional allies. It's as if Obama has embraced Donald
Rumsfeld's much-maligned concept of "old Europe" - and broadened it.
The Czech Republic and Poland were told in late-night phone calls that planned missile defence sites on their
territory were being abandoned.
Mid-level American officials often produce plans and papers about Helmand that overlook the fact that British
troops have been fighting and dying there since 2006.
Obama's foreign policy sometimes seems like it does not go much further than the concept of"le monde, c'est
moi". The limits of his transcendental personality in terms of results are becoming as apparent abroad as they
are at home.
Relations with China sunk to a new low last week after the Obama decided to sell $6.4 billion in arms to
Taiwan and to meet the Dalai Lama. After kowtowing to China by avoiding discussion of human rights in a
humiliatingly ineffectual trip last November and failing to see the Tibetan monk, Obama's decided to get tough
- though to what end is unclear.
Having offered an "unclenched fist" to Iran, Obama has been almost casually rebuffed. As Sarkozy put it:
"What have these proposals for dialogue produced for the international community? Nothing but more enriched
uranium and more centrifuges."
In the Middle East, Obama's popularity is sliding among both Israelis and Arabs and the prospects of
meaningful peace talks are dire. Requests to Nato for more troops to train Afghan security forces have fallen
largely on deaf ears. Suddenly, the US no longer feels like the indispensable nation.
For all his talk of reaching out to the world and his apologies on behalf of America, there is little that Obama
has achieved. He is liked but not respected - and there are growing doubts about whether he has the backbone or
the domestic political capital to deliver.
Obama is finding that foreign policy is about more than just talk and turning up to take a bow. For its part, the
world is realising that the man it championed as one of its own is stumbling towards isolationism.

Re: New developments on NI
Shaun regrets he cannot come here tomorrow. Here's the problem and the plan: Cameron is still quietly giving
encouragement to the Ulster Unionists, which, led by Reg Empey, are trying to scuttle the agreement somehow.
So the plan is for Shaunn to announce he will deliver a speech on Monday in the House of Commons presenting
the agreement—except that at the last second Gordon will step in on the floor for Shaun, requiring Cameron to

Re: Distant early warning signs
You should read this. This piece is prominently featured today in the Telegraph. It is a Tory
paper. But it reflects more or less the current conventional wisdom in the UK. Of course, it's
much worse in France. Sarkozy's unleashed id is the barometer. You are still perceived as
separate and even increasingly as compensatory. The more coverage of your NI role, the better,
if it can be done. (Let me discuss with Shaun on a strategy on how to brief.) The China/Google
stand was critical. What can be done in Middle East, esp Syria, push back against Avigdor
Lieberman's recent unpleasant noises, with new US ambo going? Just a thought. And: the
attitude that the president's cancellation of attendance at US-EU summit is simply a merited
position is self-defeating. First, the Europeans learned from the press, not through diplomatic
channels beforehand, treated as second class. Second, of course the EU is what it is, esp after the
new nonentities named at its head at Merkel and Sarko's behest. But to dismiss the EU because
of that is smug and complacent. If the EU has no agenda, it's really up to the US, as it was for 50
years before. It's up to the US to organize around a new agenda on the crisis of global economy,
including a common approach to China's mercantilism and climate change, etc, nuclear
proliferation, etc. Otherwise, petty trade wars will begin to dominate US-EU relations.

Barack Obama: stumbling towards
isolationism
One of the ironies of Barack Obama's presidency is that he
is increasingly distant from the world he promised to
embrace, writes Toby Harnden in Washington

Toby Hamden's American Way
Published: 2:00PM GMT 06 Feb 2010
Europeans cheered Barack Obama every step of the way to the White House.
They swooned when the candidate took his stump skills to Berlin, where he spoke of ""the
burdens of global citizenship" and promised to "remake the world".
He had lived in Indonesia as a boy, travelled to Pakistan and Africa in his youth and came from a
family that looked, as he liked to quip, "like the United Nations". Then, in his first year in office,
he made 10 trips abroad to 21 countries, making him the most travelled of all United States
presidents in their first 12 months.
So it came as a rude shock to Europeans last week when Obama decided not to bother with the
European Union knees up Madrid in May - particularly miffing Prime Minister Jose Luis
Zapatero of Spain, who, like the American president, campaigned on his opposition to the Iraq
war.
American officials intimated that they were unimpressed by European bickering over who would
sit next to the Obamas at the summit dinner and even over who would be the first leader to shake
the hand of the person that Oprah Winfrey anointed as "the One" in Iowa back in 2008.
Perhaps Obama himself was a touch irritated by Nicolas Sarkozy's new habit of mocking him.
"Obama has been in power for a year, and he has already lost three special elections," the French
president said last week. "Me, I have won two legislative elections and the EU election. What
can one say I've lost?"
The discomfort of Europe's elites indicates growing a realisation that perhaps he's just not that
into them. The fact that Hillary Clinton, Obama's Secretary of State, felt the need to point out
that "European security remains an anchor of US foreign and security policy" spoke volumes.
There is little sign that Obama feels the kind of instinctive belief in transatlantic alliances that,
for instance, President George W Bush felt. In Washington, the much-ballyhooed "special
relationship" - a phrase that Team Obama views as betraying a British inferiority complex and
cloying neediness - has never felt less special.
That's partly because Gordon Brown is viewed as so toxic by the Obama administration that
dealings with Downing Street are in a state of virtual suspended animation. But there are no
indications yet that a Prime Minister David Cameron will have the red carpet rolled out for him.
One of Obama's conceits was that he would be the "Pacific president", looking west from his
native Hawaii to China, India and Japan rather than east to America's traditional allies. It's as if
Obama has embraced Donald Rumsfeld's much-maligned concept of "old Europe" - and
broadened it.

The Czech Republic and Poland were told in late-night phone calls that planned missile defence
sites on their territory were being abandoned.
Mid-level American officials often produce plans and papers about Helmand that overlook the
fact that British troops have been fighting and dying there since 2006.
Obama's foreign policy sometimes seems like it does not go much further than the concept of "le
monde, c'est moi". The limits of his transcendental personality in terms of results are becoming
as apparent abroad as they are at home.
Relations with China sunk to a new low last week after the Obama decided to sell $6.4 billion in
arms to Taiwan and to meet the Dalai Lama. After kowtowing to China by avoiding discussion
of human rights in a humiliatingly ineffectual trip last November and failing to see the Tibetan
monk, Obama's decided to get tough - though to what end is unclear.
Having offered an "unclenched fist" to Iran, Obama has been almost casually rebuffed. As
Sarkozy put it: "What have these proposals for dialogue produced for the international
community? Nothing but more enriched uranium and more centrifuges."
In the Middle East, Obama's popularity is sliding among both Israelis and Arabs and the
prospects of meaningful peace talks are dire. Requests to Nato for more troops to train Afghan
security forces have fallen largely on deaf ears. Suddenly, the US no longer feels like the
indispensable nation.
For all his talk of reaching out to the world and his apologies on behalf of America, there is little
that Obama has achieved. He is liked but not respected - and there are growing doubts about
whether he has the backbone or the domestic political capital to deliver.
Obama is finding that foreign policy is about more than just talk and turning up to take a bow.
For its part, the world is realising that the man it championed as one of its own is stumbling
towards isolationism.

fyi: Blair's chances seem to be cratering in EU. Sid
Tony lair's bid for EU residency sinks
Ex-PM's chances of winning role slide as Sarkozy and Merkel fail to back him
• Nicholas s‘tv'at.i. and )an,..Trajf.pf in Brussels
• u!,-„ Thursday 29 October 2009 21.26 GMT
T20.,.:31::.3.1:7's hopes of becoming Europe's first sitting president were receding fast tonight as Britain admitted his chances
of success were ""fading" after the continent's centre-right leaders made it clear one of their own must have the post.
Hours after G
.nr.4,
,efl Srov.,,h delivered his strongest statement of support for Blair — disclosing that he had spoken to him
earl;er this week — British sources indicated that the former prime minister was unlikely to assume the high-profile. job.
"it would be right to describe Tony's c,hances as fading," one British source said."..slcgles. t.
..aa'r.sa; and are
not terribly enthusiastic. Silvio Berlust.-,oni remains his strongest backer."
Bialr's expected failure to secure the post of president of the European Council meant that ca,•,-,'et.,
.."it;ity.n-te was emerging
as a serious contender to assume the new post of high representative for foreign policy. The foreign secretary insisted,
however, that.he was "not available".
Miliband spoke out as British sources said it had become clear in recent days that Blair would struggle to become
president. The post is likely to be filled in the next month amid signs that the Czech Republic will become the last EU
country to ratify the Lisbon treaty.
Sarkozy, the French president, and Merkel, the German chancellor, are understood to have agreed at a dinner at the
Elysee Palace last night that the new president should be appointed from the main centre-right EPP grouping, which
brings together the parties currently ruling most EU countries.
Brown gave a hint at a press conference that Blair's candidacy was fading when he qualified his strong backing for his
predecessor by stating that there were also other candidates for the job. "Of course it may not happen and there are other
candidates as well," he said.
The prime minister's remarks came after he attended an acrimonious meeting of the European centre-left leaders this
afternoon, shortly before the EU summit in Brussels began.
Brown was understood to have had a tense exchange with Martin Schulz, the German leader of the Socialists in the
European parliament, who wants the left to assume the new foreign policy post, leaving the presidency to the centre right.
Brown told the meeting: "You need to get real. This is a unique opportunity to get a progressive politician to be the
president of the council."
But it soon became clear that Blair has no support on the left, let alone on the centre right. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero,
Spain's centre-left prime minister, for the first time publicly queried the Blair candidacy by announcing that the centre left
across the EU was more concerned with securing the other post of European foreign minister. Zapatero, who will have to
work with the new European figureheads when Spain assumes the Eti's six-month rotating presidency on 1 January, said
the European socialists were clear that they want the post of the high representative. "There is a preference for the high
representative," he said. "That is rather reasonable."
A senior Spanish official said this was the first time that Zapatero had "dropped Blair" and that the centre-left in the EU
was seeking a deal with the centre-right, led by Merkel. The centre-right would get the job coveted by Blair, while the
centre left would take the foreign minister post. The lack of support for Blair became clear when Jean Asselborn,
Luxembourg's foreign minister, launched a strong attack on him as be emerged from the meeting of Socialist leaders. "lt is
not about the person of Tony Blair. Now in the United States, Obama is the president, it is no more Mr Bush. We have a
new treaty, we have to reset Europe and we need to start with some new ideas. There is and will remain a link for the next
generation between Iraq, Bush and Tony Blair."

Downing Street wiil resist criticism that it was wrong to mount such a strong campaign in favour of Blair when it had
become clear earlier this week that his chances were fading.
Brown believes it was right — and in the national interest — to argue strongly for Blair when there was a chance to secure
such a senior post for Britain. Blair, who had a tense relationship with Brown during his decade as prime minister, will be
pleased by the strength of his successor's support.
Brown said today: "Let me say very clear that we, the British government, believe that Tony Blair would be an excellent
candidate and an excellent person to hold the job of president of the council.
"His international experience is well known, his expertise on environmental, economic and security issues is well known to
everybody throughout Europe as well as known throughout the world If you have the chance for that to happen it is in
Britain's national interest."

Google has been wierd about this whole deal but this whole Espo experience has been fascinating. Some companies will
say absolutely no for months (Qualcomm, Bloomberg, J&J) and then pop out of nowhere and say yes. Others like AU are
in for nd then decide not to give us a penny. Therefore we have to keep bugging these guys.
We WILL raise the money. We are at $54M+ (this wk Hawaii came in for $500k and Bloomberg LLC and need $7M
more. Ideally we would like to raise $10 to 11M to cover any overruns (it's getting more expensive because the US was
so late we are paying more now to build it quicker).
Where it will come from?
A- Right now we have three big companies talking to us in the range of
Haier may go from If two or three come thru big we are done.
each - Monsanto, Disney, and Oracle.
B- We also have a number of other companies like Invitrogen, Hormel, Mattel and Major League Baseball in the
range.
C-Interestingly the cities and states are going to their private funders and trying to raise money on their own to
promote their jurisdictions - Chicago, Houston, Georgia, Montana, TN. (In the past, over 20 states participated with
public funds but current budgets are tough). Maybe a chat w Mayor Bloomberg would be worthwhile. For example, I
spoke to the University of WA and they will probably get benefactors to cosponsor at $250k making them the only
university represented.
D-We have approached groups like Pharma and the fashion industry thru Diane von Furstenburg to get them to bundle
smaller companies and both have agreed to do it. I met w DVL and she wants you to know that she is very excited about
helping (they are in therM range).
E- We have talked to the elusive Chamber of Commerce again about getting SME's to raise $2-3M in smaller increments.
They are contemplating it.
Finally the two obvious industries that are not involved are the banks (and we know why) and the insurance companies
who are starting to look into the market over there.
Anyway, I did not mean to go on and on but that's where we stand and these are the potential areas to tap. We'll get
there.

Possibility of Senate Run, Nurtured and Abandoned By MICHAEL BARBARO March 03, 2010 New York Times
A few weeks ago, Harold E. Ford Jr. had a telephone conversation with his friend Doug Band, the powerful counselor to
former President Bill Clinton.
Mr. Ford, the former Tennessee congressman who now works on Wall Street, wanted to discuss a potential challenge to
Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York's Democratic primary, a possibility he had flirted with for weeks.
But Mr. Band was not encouraging. He told Mr. Ford that with Democrats reeling from political setbacks across the
country, it would be bad for the party and his career if he entered the race. ""It's not the right thing to do," he said,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation.
A Ford spokesman confirmed the call but denied that Mr. Ford had been discouraged from running or that he had been
told that doing so would hurt the party. The spokesman said Mr. Band told him the White House had pressured Mr.
Clinton into supporting Ms. Gillibrand.
Mr. Ford's decision not to run for the Senate, which he disclosed on Tuesday, came after he reached out to dozens of
donors, advocates and political leaders. In private conversations, the same worries emerged: that a race against Ms.
Gillibrand would be a brutal fight, dominated by endless debates about when he began paying taxes as a New York
resident and the sincerity of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights.
A campaign that he had hoped would focus on tax cuts and job growth would instead, he feared, become mired in
discussions of "who got there first, and who meant it the most," on social issues, he told an associate. That might allow a
Republican opponent to swoop in and take the seat from the bloodied Democratic nominee.
What seemed to weigh on him, interviews with dozens of people who have met and spoken to his advisers revealed,
was not his status as a carpetbagger who had moved to New York from Tennessee, but rather the reality that there were
few easy constituencies for him to grab on to, outside of Wall Street, where he has worked since moving here in 2006.
Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as disclosing private conversations.
As he hopscotched from city to city, charming crowds with bits of his Southern biography, signs of trouble for Mr. Ford
emerged. His voting record in Congress put him on the right fringes of state Democrats, and his $2 million-a-year job at
Merrill Lynch made it hard to run as a Scott Brown-style populist.
What seemed like an improbable, even impossible campaign had its roots in conversations, many dating back a year,
among Mr. Ford, 39, and a coterie of powerful friends from New York City, Washington and Los Angeles.
Over dinner last July at the Post House, a clubby steakhouse on the Upper East Side, Richard Plepler, a co-president of
HBO, urged Mr. Ford to restart his political career in New York. "I think you should give this serious thought," he said, of
the Senate race. Mr. Ford replied that he would.
After the dinner, Mr. Plepler sent an e-mail message to Douglas E. Schoen, a top Democratic pollster, to bounce the idea
off him. Mr. Schoen was intrigued, and as he studied public polls, became convinced that Mr. Ford's best shot at
reaching the Senate was to wage a campaign against Ms. Gillibrand.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767893 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767893 Date: 08/31/2015
Over the next few months, Mr. Ford sounded out many of New York's wealthiest and most politically connected
executives, frequently over breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue: Robert Wolf, the head of the United States
investment banking division at UBS; Ronald Perelman, the billionaire chairman of Revlon; and Steven Rattner, the
founder of Quadrangle, the private equity firm, all of whom are big Democratic donors.
Mr. Rattner told Mr. Ford, who is also a political analyst on NBC, that money would not be a problem. "You can raise the
money," he told him in December.
Yet several big-name donors warned him that Ms. Gillibrand, a relentless campaigner, had beaten him to the punch.
"She has already locked a lot of Wall Street up" was the message that Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge fund manager,
conveyed to Mr. Ford in a telephone conversation.
As Mr. Ford traveled outside New York City, especially upstate, he found political support for Ms. Gillibrand to be
shallow, and the hunger for change palpable. The mayor of Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, told him that residents there
were "scared and desperate" about the economy, and she told Mr. Ford that Ms. Gillibrand was a rare presence in her
city.
But Ms. Gillibrand's strategy of portraying Mr. Ford as a showboating out-of-towner was starting to stick. In late January,
the head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, held a luncheon for Mr. Ford, and invited local
lawmakers. During a two-hour question-and-answer session, Marty Markowitz, the borough president, pointed to
several up-and-coming state senators around the room and observed that all of them had greater experience in New
York politics than Mr. Ford.
"With all due respect," he asked Mr. Ford, "why do you think you have what it takes to be New York's senator?"
Even lawmakers who seemed open to a Ford candidacy warned him that peeling away support from Ms. Gillibrand
would be harder than it seemed.
Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, told Mr. Ford between bites of an omelet at a diner near his office, "It's
difficult to make a strong case against her here." Ms. Gillibrand, he explained, had just secured $4 million worth of
federal stimulus money to train his constituents for green jobs. Mr. Ford knew that some liberals would attack his
relatively conservative voting record but, those he spoke with said, he was taken aback by the depth of the anger he
encountered from advocates for abortion rights and gay marriage.
After reporters found examples of Mr. Ford calling himself pro-life during his time in Congress, Mr. Ford vehemently
pushed back, saying he had always supported a woman's right to choose. He assumed that would put the matter to rest.
It did not. "He was dumbfounded that it kept tripping him up," a friend said.
One of Mr. Ford's top advisers, Bradley Tusk, the campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's 2009 re-election,
arranged a meeting for Mr. Ford with a close Bloomberg ally, Kelli Conlin, the head of Naral-Pro Choice of New York. Mr.
Ford expected a polite conversation that would help neutralize a foe. Ms. Conlin, however, started the meeting by
quizzing Mr. Ford on his voting record and public statements.
Did he realize, she asked, that he had backed legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions even when a woman's
health is in danger?
Far from conciliatory, Mr. Ford wanted to know why Naral allowed Ms. Gillibrand to vote for a health care bill that cut
off financing for abortions. "You gave her a pass," he said. Before leaving, Mr. Ford told Ms. Conlin that if he chose to
run he hoped to return to ask for the group's support. Ms. Conlin responded: "We can never support you if you take
these positions." Mr. Ford "looked shocked," a person in the room said.

His meeting with gay rights advocates on Feb. 24 was rockier still. When he walked into the headquarters of the
Stonewall Democrats in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, he was greeted by signs that read "Liar!" and "Go
home snake oil Harry," a reference to his recent support for gay marriage after having twice voted to outlaw it in
Congress.
A few days later, the results of a poll that Mr. Ford had paid for out of his own pocket began to trickle in, giving his
advisers pause. His negative ratings had increased slightly. A liberal primary electorate seemed wary about portions of
his record. Ms. Gillibrand remained vulnerable, the data showed, but Mr. Ford's chance seemed to be 50-50. "It was not
a slam dunk, at all," said a person who spoke with him and was briefed on the data.
Mr. Tusk had told associates that to win, Mr. Ford needed 80 percent of the state's black vote, a tall order, but not
inconceivable for an African-American in a Democratic primary. But by the end of the week, Gov. David A. Paterson and
Representative Charles B. Rangel had become embroiled in ethics scandals. New York's black political elite was in
seeming disarray, just when he needed them to be organized and unified.
By Sunday, he had made up his mind not to run. He told his wife, Emily, and his father, former Representative Harold
Ford Sr. He began to call friends the next evening, leaving many of them brief messages.
"I'm not going to run this time," he said in one message. "Thank you for your support."

Karl, Frank, Richard.,
I hope in the next few days we can focus on some of the themes in the following:
1. On 9 April, I had lunch in Kabul with expert on
Afghanistan now based at was on his way back B6
to Washington via a meeting in Paris with the French Political Director. He had just spend three
weeks in Kandahar and Gardez, his first visit since August last year. He came across as patriotic, but
deeply worried, speaking in a monologue, mostly in French.
OVERALL SITUATION
2. said that his assessment was that the overall situation had deteriorated sharply since his
last visit. The Taliban were stronger, and more confident, than ever. ISAF was inflicting heavy losses
on them, but the scale was as nothing compared with what the mujahideen had endured at the hands
of the Russians. Moreover, the change in rules of engagement — to prevent civilian casualties, and
fewer night raids — had been interpreted by the Taliban as signalling weakness on NATO's part. In
view, most of the East, and Kunduz, was effectively lost to the Taliban and their fellow
travellers. US forces in the East controlled the ground they occupied or passed over, but little more:
they were in a similar position to the Soviet Army. Moreover, the population did not want to back
them, and was resisting US attempts to set up tribal militias or implant US Special Forces in the
villages, did, however, acknowledge that he had heard that the US Marines in Helmand were
behaving much more sensitively towards the population than had been expected. But the situation in
Marjah was not good. Of course, the Marines held the ground, but violence would continue for
months or years. This did not offer the positive signal of momentum for which the Coalition had been
hoping.
KANDAHAR

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768229 Date: 08/31/2015
3. aid repeatedly that he did not understand the strategy in Kandahar. The Taliban had
effectively penetrated, and largely controlled, a city of one million people. The ANP there were
largely Barakzai, and working for either or both of the Taliban or Ahmed Wali Karzai's network. AWK
was at the centre of a vast criminal enterprise: his brother-in-law was one of the largest drug
traffickers in the south. When I said that surely ISAF could gradually occupy the city, squeezing the
Taliban back and out, said he was not certain of that: he thought that there might well be quite
violent resistance from the Taliban. He was also dismissive of the ISAF strategy of ""managing" AWK:
if the latter really did abandon his criminal ways, he would be dead. He would lose the protection of
his militias. In such situations, one could only move forward, or go into prison or exile: there was no
going back. AWK had just too many enemies to survive in Kandahar without the protection of his own
criminal networks, guess was that AWK would promise to be good, but in reality stick to his
old habits, and hope to profit from the action taken by ISAF against the Taliban. was
dismissive of efforts to empower Governor Weesa, who would not survive five minutes in Kandahar
without Western support and protection. Although Weesa came from the area, he had no power base,
and, with his Canadian nationality, was regarded by the Kandaharis as a foreigner.
4. was also sceptical as to whether ISAF could "shura" its way to success in Kandahar. On the
military side, he thought ISAF just couldn't generate the force densities necessary to control the city:
for example, he thought the Argandab would require getting on for 15,000 troops to control it
properly. The city of Kandahar would require some 10,000 fresh police, who were just not available.
NEXT STEPS
5. said he was worried about where the coalition was heading. The best that could be
expected was a messy stalemate in Kandahar, but the probability was, by the early autumn, an
outcome that would not look at all like success, wondered whether ISAF really did need to go
ahead with its plan to take Kandahar: in view, he was riding for a fall. I said that I did not see
how we could pull back now. The planners were well aware of the risks, but wanted to generate
positive momentum to enable a political process to take hold.
MAKING PEACE
6. said that, in his view, the only way out now was a negotiated peace with the Taliban and all
the other parties to the conflict. He thought that Pakistan would need to help Karzai and the
Americans open such a dialogue with the Taliban, but, sooner or later, both Pakistan and Karzai
would need to be moved to one side, and there would need to be direct talks between the Americans
and the Taliban. The Taliban would not make a final peace with Karzai, who had little credibility left.
Similarly, the senior Taliban leaders would need to be brought across the border into Afghanistan, to
get them out from under the control of the ISI. All this would need deception and trickery: for the first
time in his career, could see that diplomats were needed, in this case to finesse a delicate
process, involving multiple negotiations. Karzai would have to eased out, but gently and with plenty
of public respect.
7. said that there would need to be a cease-fire, and wondered why ISAF couldn't occupy the
high ground by being the first to offer such a move. There would also have to be frank discussions
about the withdrawal of foreign forces.
8. said that his main worry was that the Obama Administration would waste another year
ploughing on with a military campaign which could deliver stalemate at best, and a serious reverse at
worst. Then, with the 2011-12 Presidential election campaign getting going, the White House would
panic, handing the problem to Pakistan, and pull US troops out more quickly than the situation

merited. It was vital to get ahead of the curve, and start making preparations now for a messy
political process that could last months or years.
9. said that he had known from 2001 that the Western intervention in Afghanistan had been
fraught with danger. He had suspected then, and knew even more strongly now, that the Taliban
could not be defeated or even properly contained by military means. Once again, he was sick with
worry at the way things were going. He had thought that the Obama Administration had understood
that the solutions in Afghanistan were political, not military. He was trying to think how he and other
concerned experts could shock the Administration in getting a political grip on the situation: he was
considering a joint op-ed by a group of experts. The seriousness of the situation meant that such an
article would have to concentrate on essentials: much of the talk about counter-insurgency (in what
was an Afghan civil war) and development and governance was no more than "poetry".
10. I pointed out to the political difficulties for the US and other Western governments in
negotiating direct with the Taliban. Although the principle of a negotiated peace was accepted, more
or less, in Washington and London, there was a long way to go before politicians fully addressed
what that might involve. Hence the argument that we needed first to get on the front foot militarily. It
would help if the Taliban could be pinned down on politically neuralgic issues, such as women's rights
and social restrictions, said that, in a serious negotiation, he thought such undertakings could
be extracted from the Taliban: again, however, the sooner work started on that, the more chance of a
satisfactory result.
11. I told that much of this thinking coincided with the views expressed by the Foreign
Secretary in his article in The New York Review of Books of 29 April 2010 had missed the MIT
speech, as he had been in Kandahar). The UK election campaign meant that there was little that
could be done over the next few weeks, apart from making sure that incoming or returning Ministers
had the best possible advice. After the election, there was clearly a case for a good strategic
discussion between the British Prime Minister and the American President: we all needed to raise our
eyes from the urgent tactical preoccupations in the south to the really important strategic issues, of
harvesting political success from military progress.

US troops withdrawing en masse from Haiti BEN FOX,Associated Press Writers JENNIFER KAY,Associated Press Writers
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) 91U.S. troops are withdrawing from the shattered capital, leaving many Haitians anxious
that the most visible portion of international is ending even as the city is still mired in misery and vulnerable to unrest.
As troops packed their duffels and began to fly home this weekend, Haitians and some aid workers wondered whether
U.N. peacekeepers and local police are up to the task of maintaining order. More than a half-million people still live in
vast encampments that have grown more unpleasant in recent days with the early onset of rainy season.
Some also fear the departure of the American troops is a sign of dwindling international interest in the plight of the
Haitian people following the catastrophic Jan. 12 earthquake.
""I would like for them to stay in Haiti until they rebuild the country and everybody can go back to their house," said
Marjorie Louis, a 27-year-old mother of two, as she warmed a bowl of beans for her family over a charcoal fire on the
fake grass of the national stadium.
U.S. officials say the long-anticipated draw down of troops is not a sign of waning commitment to Haiti, only a change in
the nature of the operation. Security will now be the responsibility of the 10,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force and
the Haitian police.
A smaller number of U.S. forces 11 the exact number has not yet been determined 11 will be needed as the U.N. and
Haitian government reassert control, said Gen. Douglas Fraser, head of U.S. Southern Command, which runs the Haiti
operation.
"Our mission is largely accomplished," Fraser said.
American forces arrived in the immediate aftermath of the quake to treat the wounded, provide emergency water and
rations and help prevent a feared outbreak of violence among desperate survivors. They also helped reopen the airport
and seaport.
There has been no widespread violence but security is a real issue. A U.N. food convoy traveling from Gonaives to
Dessalines on Friday was stopped and overrun by people, who looted two trucks before peacekeepers regained control,
U.N. officials said.
They managed to escort the other two back to Gonaives. There were no reports of injuries.

The military operation was criticized by some Haitian senators and foreign leaders as heavy-handed and inappropriate in
a country that had been occupied by American forces for nearly two decades in the early 20th century. But ordinary
Haitians largely welcomed the troops, many out of disenchantment with their own government.
"They should stay because they have been doing a good job," 35-year-old Lesly Pierre said as his family prepared dinner
under a tarp at an encampment in Petionville. "If it was up to our government, we wouldn't have gotten any help at all."
U.S. soldiers said they had nothing but warm encounters with the Haitian people.
"They're real good people. They just want help," Army Private First Class Troy Sims, a 19-year-old from Fresno,
California, said as he prepared to board a flight back to the U.S. "I feel that us being here helped a lot. If we weren't
here, things probably would have gotten out of control."
There are now about 11,000 troops, more than half of them on ships just off the coast, down from a peak of around
20,000 on Feb. 1. The total is expected to drop to about 8,000 in coming days as the withdrawal gathers steam. The
military said more than 700 paratroopers left this weekend.
Soldiers are now gone from the General Hospital, where they once directed traffic and kept order amid the chaos of
mass casualties. There are no more Haitian patients on board the USNS Comfort, which treated 8,600 people after the
quake. At a country club in Petionville, where some 100,000 Haitians are living in rough shelters in a muddy ravine, only
a few soldiers remain of the several hundred there after the disaster.
Alison Thompson said she was nervous about the smaller U.S. troop contingent.
"Soon we are not going to have any security," said Thompson, medical coordinator of the Jenkins/Penn Relief
Organization, which runs a field hospital at the edge of the ravine. "Everybody is just so worried that they are pulling out
because it's going to get dangerous."
It was the same concern for Louis at the national stadium.
"If the troublemakers see that there is some kind of force here, they will think twice before they do anything," she said.
"They are already getting ready to stir up trouble."
But Ted Constan, chief program officer for Partners in Health, said that the way to address security is to get adequate
shelter and other aid to the hundreds of thousands of people who are now stranded in squalid encampments.
"The real solution is to deliver services ... rather than turn Haiti into a military state," he said.

Right now we have committed to talking further with the Cubans about reconstruction efforts and in further clarifying
the role they would play with HUEH. There are many areas we could work together with the Cubans that would be
beneficial to the Haitian medical system. You will still have the opportunity to call final package. We will make sure we

In our TA strategy that ( attached in the original email), we
outline the areas we can specifically support them in developing the capabilities needed to be a strong oversight
National office of Health that can lead and support the Department ministries in carrying out the work.
Right now we have committed to talking further with the Cubans about reconstruction efforts and in further clarifying
the role they would play with HUEH. There are many areas we could work together with the Cubans that would be
beneficial to the Haitian medical system. You will still have the opportunity to call final package. We will make sure we
are clear where our proposal overlaps with the final vision of the Haitians and other donors.
Whole of Government Approach:

The word from Ramallah is quite positive. IF there are no announcements this week, we anticipate that the Arab League
Follow-up Committee will give its blessing on May 1 and Sen Mitchell can return to the region to start talking substance.
Given the Israelis' warning, this is a real If.
Karl/Frank will go in today to walk Karzai through the particulars of the visit - the only thorny part is that it has dropped
from 4 to 3 days. But it has all the same elements, plus a dinner with Biden.
Did you see reports that Iran has dropped out of the running for the UNSC? Trying to confirm.
Andrew S. will be sending you a long memo that responds to DOD's pooling proposals - it conveys a desire to work
together with DOD on this and offers some alternative ideas. He also canvassed the building on other topics and will
send a list up for your book tonight. He and I agreed that the list should just be for reference and that your approach of
having informal conversation on the big topics is the right one.
You saw CDM's email about the Sudan ad. Ben emailed yesterday to say he wants to talk Sudan comms strategy going
forward. Hopefully I'll reach him today. I know CDM is talking to Denis.

Judith,
Below is a rough outline of your trip to Doha, as it currently stands.
LOGISTICS:
You are currently scheduled to arrive in Doha on May 1 at 6:30 and depart May 2 at 7 pm. Traveling with you
will be Kitty DiMartino, Joe Mellott, Mark Davidson, and GSEC's LTC Eric Schoennauer. Dana Smith will fly
in from the Media Hub in Dubai to meet you in Doha.
KEY EVENTS:
Dinner with Al Jazeera (AJ) staff: AJ Director General Wadah Khanfar will host a dinner on May 1 with
senior AJ staff, including AJ English Managing Director Tony Burman. We expect 7 people on the AJ side and
6 on ours. (The dinner is schedule for 8pm in a private room in the Four Seasons; post is making reservations
for the party to stay in the same hotel.)
Meeting with AJ Board Members at AJ Headquarters: This will give you an opportunity to engage the
Qatari leadership of the network. Discussions topics should include the mid-May Washington visit by some AJ
Board representatives. We expect Wadah Khanfar to also participate in this meeting.
(TBC) Meeting with Prime Minister Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani (HBJ): As PM, HBJ is the
ultimate Qatari authority on AJ. The meeting will also allow you to raise bi-lateral engagement issues as
necessary. We expect to know in a few days if HBJ will be available.
Meetings with CENTCOM: You will meet with CENTCOM staff at Al Udeid airbase just outside of
Doha. They will brief you on their within their AOR, but with particular B1
focus on activities ir 1.4(D)

Feature on AJ Arabic: 15 minute ""feature" piece filmed at AJ Studios on the Administration's commitment to
engagement with Muslim communities worldwide. This will be a good opportunity to highlight the
Entrepreneurship Summit. We can expect you to also get questions on PD programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan,
and Iraq. You will be interviewed by one of AJ's "top" journalists; exactly who is still to be determined. The
interview will be in English with simultaneous interpretation into Arabic. It will likely air a number of times on
AJ.
Feature on AJ English: This would be a second 15 minute "feature" piece similar to the one for AJ Arabic. If
we are pressed for time we can consider just doing the AJ Arabic feature.
Roundtable with local Qatari media: This will include journalists from a number of local Qatari media
outlets. This is another opportunity to talk about the Administration's commitment to engagement, but with a
more targeted focus on bilateral engagement and exchange programs.
Note — Wadah Khanfar has been closely engaged on, if not driving, the portions of your program that deal with
AJ. Post reports that he is very pleased to have this opportunity for you to engage with AJ leadership in Doha.
Best,

Mort Zuckerman: World Sees Obama as Incompetent and Amateur
The president is well-intentioned but can't walk the walk on the world stage
By Mortimer B. Zuckerman
Posted June 18, 2010
President Obama came into office as the heir to a great foreign policy legacy enjoyed by every recent U.S. president.
Why? Because the United States stands on top of the power ladder, not necessarily as the dominant power, but
certainly as the leading one. As such we are the sole nation capable of exercising global leadership on a whole range of
international issues from security, trade, and climate to counterterrorism. We also benefit from the fact that most
countries distrust the United States far less than they distrust one another, so we uniquely have the power to build
coalitions. As a result, most of the world still looks to Washington for help in their region and protection against
potential regional threats.
Yet, the Iraq war lingers; Afghanistan continues to be immersed in an endless cycle of tribalism, corruption, and Islamist
resurgence; Guantanamo remains open; Iran sees how North Korea toys with Obama and continues its programs to
develop nuclear weapons and missiles; Cuba spurns America's offers of a greater opening; and the Palestinians and
Israelis find that it is U.S. policy positions that defer serious negotiations, the direct opposite of what the Obama
administration hoped for.
The reviews of Obama's performance have been disappointing. He has seemed uncomfortable in the role of leading
other nations, and often seems to suggest there is nothing special about America's role in the world. The global
community was puzzled over the pictures of Obama bowing to some of the world's leaders and surprised by his
gratuitous criticisms of and apologies for America's foreign policy under the previous administration of George W. Bush.
One Middle East authority, Fouad Ajami, pointed out that Obama seems unaware that it is bad form and even a great
moral lapse to speak ill of one's own tribe while in the lands of others.
Even in Britain, for decades our closest ally, the talk in the press—supported by polls—is about the end of the "special
relationship" with America. French President Nicolas Sarkozy openly criticized Obama for months, including a direct
attack on his policies at the United Nations. Sarkozy cited the need to recognize the real world, not the virtual world, a
clear reference to Obama's speech on nuclear weapons. When the French president is seen as tougher than the
American president, you have to know that something is awry. Vladimir Putin of Russia has publicly scorned a number of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769103 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769103 Date: 08/31/2015
Oba ma's visions. Relations with the Chinese leadership got off to a bad start with the president's poorly-organized visit
to China, where his hosts treated him disdainfully and prevented him from speaking to a national television audience of
the Chinese people. The Chinese behavior was unprecedented when compared to visits by other U.S. presidents.
Obama's policy on Afghanistan—supporting a surge in troops, but setting a date next year when they will begin to
withdraw—not only gave a mixed signal, but provided an incentive for the Taliban just to wait us out. The withdrawal
part of the policy was meant to satisfy a domestic constituency, but succeeded in upsetting all of our allies in the region.
Further anxiety was provoked by Obama's severe public criticism of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and his coterie of
family and friends for their lackluster leadership, followed by a reversal of sorts regarding the same leaders.
Obama clearly wishes to do good and means well. But he is one of those people who believe that the world was born
with the word and exists by means of persuasion, such that there is no person or country that you cannot, by means of
logical and moral argument, bring around to your side. He speaks as a teacher, as someone imparting values and
generalities appropriate for a Sunday morning sermon, not as a tough-minded leader. He urges that things "must be
done" and "should be done" and that "it is time" to do them. As the former president of the Council on Foreign
Relations, Les Gelb, put it, there is "the impression that Obama might confuse speeches with policy." Another journalist
put it differently when he described Obama as an "NPR [National Public Radio] president who gives wonderful
speeches." In other words, he talks the talk but doesn't know how to walk the walk. The Obama presidency has so far
been characterized by a well-intentioned but excessive belief in the power of rhetoric with too little appreciation of
reality and loyalty.
In his Cairo speech about America and the Muslim world, Obama managed to sway Arab public opinion but was unable
to budge any Arab leader. Even the king of Saudi Arabia, a country that depends on America for its survival, reacted with
disappointment and dismay. Obama's meeting with the king was widely described as a disaster. This is but one example
of an absence of the personal chemistry that characterized the relationships that Presidents Clinton and Bush had with
world leaders. This is a serious matter because foreign policy entails an understanding of the personal and political
circumstances of the leaders as well as the cultural and historical factors of the countries we deal with.
Les Gelb wrote of Obama, "He is so self-confident that he believes he can make decisions on the most complicated of
issues after only hours of discussion." Strategic decisions go well beyond being smart, which Obama certainly is. They
must be based on experience that discerns what works, what doesn't—and why. This requires experienced staffing,
which Obama and his top appointees simply do not seem to have. Or as one Middle East commentator put it, "There are
always two chess games going on. One is on the top of the table, the other is below the table. The latter is the one that
counts, but the Americans don't know how to play that game."
Recent U.S. attempts to introduce more meaningful sanctions against Iran produced a U.N. resolution that is way less
than the "crippling" sanctions the administration promised. The United States even failed to achieve the political benefit
of a unanimous Security Council vote. Turkey, the Muslim anchor of NATO for almost 60 years, and Brazil, our largest ally
in Latin America, voted against our resolution. Could it be that these long-standing U.S. allies, who gave cover to
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Iran's nuclear ambitions, have decided that there is no cost in lining up with America's most
serious enemies and no gain in lining up with this administration?
The end result is that a critical mass of influential people in world affairs who once held high hopes for the president
have begun to wonder whether they misjudged the man. They are no longer dazzled by his rock star personality and
there is a sense that there is something amateurish and even incompetent about how Obama is managing U.S. power.
For example, Obama has asserted that America is not at war with the Muslim world. The problem is that parts of the
Muslim world are at war with America and the West. Obama feels, fairly enough, that America must be contrite in its
dealings with the Muslim world. But he has failed to address the religious intolerance, failing economies, tribalism, and
gender apartheid that together contribute to jihadist extremism. This was startling and clear when he chose not to
publicly support the Iranians who went to the streets in opposition to their oppressive government, based on a
judgment that our support might be counterproductive. Yet, he reaches out instead to the likes of Bashar Assad of Syria,
Iran's agent in the Arab world, sending our ambassador back to Syria even as it continues to rearm Hezbollah in Lebanon
and expands its role in the lran-Hezbollah-Hamas alliance.

The underlying issue is that the Arab world has different estimates on how to deal with an aggressive, expansionist Iran.
The Arabs believe you do not deal with Iran with the open hand of a handshake but with the clenched fist of power.
Arab leaders fear an Iran proceeding full steam with its nuclear weapons program on top of its programs to develop
intermediate-range ballistic missiles. All the while centrifuges keep spinning in Iran, and Arab leaders ask whether Iran
will be emboldened by what they interpret as American weakness and faltering willpower. They did not see Obama or
his administration as understanding the region, where naiveté is interpreted as a weakness of character, as amateurism,
and as proof of the absence of the tough stuff of which leaders are made. (That's why many Arab leaders were appalled
at the decision to have a civilian trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York. After 9/11, many of them had engaged
in secret counterterrorism activities under the umbrella of an American promise that these activities would never be
made public; now they feared that this would be the exact consequence of an open trial.)
America right now appears to be unreliable to traditional friends, compliant to rivals, and weak to enemies. One
renowned Asian leader stated recently at a private dinner in the United States, "We in Asia are convinced that Obama is
not strong enough to confront his opponents, but we fear that he is not strong enough to support his friends."
The United States for 60 years has met its responsibilities as the leader and the defender of the democracies of the free
world. We have policed the sea lanes, protected the air and space domains, countered terrorism, responded to
genocide, and been the bulwark against rogue states engaging in aggression. The world now senses, in the context of
the erosion of America's economic power and the pressures of our budget deficits, that we will compress our
commitments. But the world needs the vision, idealism, and strong leadership that America brings to international
affairs. This can be done and must be done. But we are the only ones who can do it.

Obama's diplomacy, not fully engaged
By Jackson Diehl
Monday, May 3, 2010; A15
Barack Obama's foreign policy has been defined so far by his attempts to ""engage" with adversaries or rivals of
the United States, such as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of Iran and Dmitry Medvedev of Russia. The results have
been mixed. But now the president's focus is visibly shifting. In the next 18 months, Obama's record abroad will
be made or broken by his ability to do business with two nominal U.S. allies: Hamid Karzai and Binyamin
Netanyahu.
Karzai has become the hardest problem in Obama's Afghanistan surge, one that might be summed up as "can't
win with him, can't win without him." Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu holds the key to whether Israel will be
prepared to accept a Palestinian state within the two-year time frame Obama has established -- and also,
perhaps, whether Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons will lead to war.
Both men are prickly and somewhat inscrutable. Both know their countries and their own careers depend on
support from the United States, but both are also resistant to key elements of Obama's policies. Handling them
well requires skillful and subtle diplomacy by the U.S. president and by those who carry out his policies.
And Obama has not done well. In fact, his treatment of the Israeli and Afghan leaders during one week in late
March -- immediately after his victory on health care -- marked a low point of his performance as president.
First, Obama seized on an errant Israeli announcement about housing construction in East Jerusalem to reopen a
pointless battle with Netanyahu. During a disastrous March 23 meeting at the White House, Obama demanded -
- in vain -- that Israel stop all building in Jerusalem; and at one point he left Netanyahu and his delegation to
stew in the Roosevelt room while he retired to the second-floor residence for dinner.
Five days later, Obama flew to Kabul for another cold meeting, this time with Karzai. In a briefing for reporters
on the plane, national security adviser James Jones made it clear that Obama was displeased with Karzai's lack
of progress since beginning a new term as president last fall. In case there was any doubt, Obama spelled out
that dissatisfaction in a television interview a day after his return.

Was it hubris from health care that brought on this burst of presidential imperialism? Whatever the cause, the
results were disastrous. Netanyahu retreated to Jerusalem, where, after a couple of weeks of sulking, he
defiantly announced that settlement construction in Jerusalem would continue. Karzai summoned Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Kabul, then delivered a tirade against Western interference that concluded
with a threat to join the Taliban.
The administration has spent the past month cleaning up this mess. Obama abruptly changed his approach,
sending a note to Karzai in early April thanking him for the Kabul visit and confirming his invitation to visit
Washington in May -- a trip that, just days earlier, the White House had hinted at canceling. Meanwhile, the
president and a good part of his Cabinet have been heaping love on Israel -- if not precisely Netanyahu -- by
proclaiming their commitment to the relationship in speech after speech before pro-Israel groups.
The result is that the administration now has a detailed plan for working with Karzai over the next several
months. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been delayed for two months by the flap over Jerusalem,
might finally begin this week. Quiet diplomacy by the administration's special envoys in the Middle East and
Afghanistan, George Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke, has achieved what presidential lectures did not.
The underlying problems, however, haven't changed. Karzai still has little appetite for attacking the corruption
in his government or rallying support for U.S. military campaigns against the Taliban. Netanyahu remains
wedded to a right-wing coalition that would not allow him to make significant concessions in peace
negotiations, even if he wanted to.
Obama has to find a way to coax each of them toward a change of course. Public bullying won't do it.
Assurances of U.S. support and stroking by special envoys go only so far. What's missing is personal chemistry
and confidence, the construction of a bond between leaders that can persuade a U.S. ally to take a risk; in other
words, presidential "engagement." Isn't that what Obama promised?

Internet Freedom, Hillary Clinton and Being the Web's First Global Diplomat (VIDEO)
When it comes to education and how students learn in the 21st century, when it comes to developing businesses and
encouraging entrepreneurship in a flattening digital marketplace, when it comes to forming social connections
regardless of geographic, linguistic and cultural borders -- when it comes to promoting democracy and protecting the
rights of individuals around the world -- no two words, no other phrase, holds more value. It may sound trite but it's true
-- just ask students and activists in Iran and China. With the Internet comes freedom. With freedom comes the Internet.
In countless ways, for many people, the Internet is freedom.
Hillary Clinton underlined that reality in a bold, impassioned speech at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. this morning.
Words like ""bold" and "impassioned" are not usually found in most of the mainstream media's caricature of Clinton.
Nevertheless, the Secretary of State gave by far the most important speech about Internet freedom delivered by a top
U.S. official. What makes it all the more notable is the fact that it was given by arguably the most recognizable female
political figure in the world. In parts of the Middle East, women are beaten and killed by relatives who find out they are
using sites like Twitter and Facebook. "Honor" beatings, they're called.
"Given the magnitude of the challenges we're facing, we need people around the world to pool their knowledge and
creativity to help rebuild the global economy, protect our environment, defeat violent extremism and build a future in
which every human being can realize their God-given potential," said Clinton, who announced a new $15 million project
to help more women, young people and citizen groups to get online. (WATCH: Video of her speech is below.)
Clinton, speaking in broad strokes and finer details, outlined what she called the "five key freedoms of the Internet age."
Freedom to connect online anywhere. Freedom of speech. Freedom of worship.
Freedom from fear of cyber attacks. "In an interconnected world," she said, "an attack on one nation's networks can be
an attack on all."
Freedom of "want" -- which means that the here-comes-everybody ethos of the Web, the fact that we can bear witness
to each other online, can be leveraged in helping relieve suffering worldwide.
On the Twitterverse, where Internet observers and activists commented on Clinton's remarks and her subsequent Q&A
in real time, some took note of her "disappointing" answers regarding China's alleged cyber attacks targeted at human
rights activists. And inevitably, immediate coverage of the speech in our conflict-driven mainstream media, from the

New York Times to the Associated Press, focused on the China-Google dispute, which is being closely watched by human
rights activists, government officials and Internet companies. But the overall meaning and message of her remarks,
beyond the China-Google stand-off, cannot be overstated. The Internet, after all, was born in America, created by our
researches and funded by our government. With help and input from other countries, the Web's evolving ethos and
guiding principles should be shaped by America -- and, naturally, by America's top diplomat.
"Sec. Clinton once and for all established the fact that free speech and free enterprise can no longer be achieved unless
we have Internet freedom," Andrew Rasiej, founder of the Personal Democracy Forum, an annual conference on
technology's impact on politics and policy, told me shortly after Clinton's remarks. He called her speech nothing short of
a "milestone" in the future of American foreign policy."
"In a world where billions are connected with each other through technology -- through the Internet and mobile phones
-- it is imperative that governments recognize that it's easier and faster for people to connect with each other than for
governments to connect with their citizens. Any government that fails to understand this dynamic will left in the history
books," Rasiej continued."
Less than two weeks ago, Clinton hosted a nearly two-hour dinner for some of the tech industry's leading thinkers and
innovators. It was a small, intimate affair, and guests included Twitter creator Jack Dorsey, Google CEO Eric Schmidt and
Howcast CEO and co-founder Jason Liebman, who wrote about the event for HuffPostTech in a blog titled "Facebook,
YouTube and Twitter Are Tools For Diplomacy." Rasiej was one of the guests. Clinton is interested in how technology can
spur innovation within the State Department and in countries that the U.S.
has interest in supporting, Rasiej said. Accompanying Clinton in the dinner was her senior staff and her growing new
media department; most recently, Katie Jacobs Stanton, a former Google exec who joined the White House as its
director of citizen participation, joined the State Department.
There's a bit of irony at work here. Early in the long, bruising primary campaign that pitted the establishment-backed
former first lady turned New York senator against the little-known insurgent junior senator from Illinois, Clinton was
considered less Web-savvy than Barack Obama. Hers was a top-down, command-and-control operation, online
observers suggested. In fact, the first online attack ad that spread on YouTube and foreshadowed the narrative of their
historic fight for the Democratic nomination portrayed Clinton as the old PC and Obama as the shiny new Mac.
"After having lost to Obama, especially to Obama's use of the Internet in attracting and mobilizing supporters," Rasiej
pointed out, "Clinton is now leading the way within the Obama administration in recognizing the transformational
opportunities that the Internet can provide."
Using DipNote, the State Department's blog, recording videos from all corners of the world, especially where girls and
women are considered second-class citizens, leveraging technological tools that, as we're seeing in the response and
outpouring of support for Haiti, allow us to become "global citizens," Clinton can be the Web's first global diplomat.

Aides to U.S. general in Afghanistan slam Obama:
report
20 mins ago
WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Aides to the top U.S. general in Afghanistan insulted some of President Barack Obama's closest advisers,
calling one a ""clown" and another a "wounded animal," in an article to be published Friday in Rolling Stone magazine.
The article also quotes an aide describing the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal's
"disappointment" with his initial one-on-one meeting with Obama last year.
Quoting all the McChrystal aides anonymously, the article portrays a split between the U.S. military and Obama's advisers at an
extremely sensitive moment for the Pentagon, which is fending off criticism of its strategy to turn around the nearly nine-year-old
Afghan war.
The Pentagon had no immediate comment about the article, which has been brought to the attention of senior officials.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769911 Date: 08/31/2015
It quotes a member of McChrystal's team making jokes about Vice President Joe Biden, who was seen as critical of the general's
efforts to escalate the conflict and who had favored a more limited counter-terrorism approach.
"Biden?" the aide was quoted as saying. "Did you say: Bite me?"
Another aide called White House National Security Adviser Jim Jones, a retired four star general, a "clown" who was "stuck in 1985."
It quoted an adviser to McChrystal dismissing an early meeting with Obama as a "10-minute photo op."
"Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. The boss was pretty disappointed," the adviser told the magazine.
McChrystal, a famous workaholic said to sleep just four hours a day, was brought into Afghanistan a year ago after his predecessor
was pushed out.
The article portrays his teams as disapproving of the Obama administration, with the exception of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
who backed McCrystal's request for additional troops in Afghanistan.
Some of the strongest criticism was reserved for Richard Holbrooke, Obama's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
"The boss says he's like a wounded animal," a member of the general's team is quoted as saying. "Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors
that he's going to get fired, so that makes him dangerous."
McChrystal was quoted as saying he felt "betrayed" by the leak of a classified cable from U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl
Eikenberry last year. The cable raised doubts about sending more troops to shore up an Afghan government already lacking in
credibility.
"I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said anything like that to us before," McChrystal was quoted as saying in the
article.
"Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so."

McChrystal's Next Offensive?
Relations between the U.S. military and civilians in the Obama administration have been tense since last year's three-month review of Afghan war strategy, a state of affairs
unlikely to be helped by a new profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the overall commander in Afghanistan, that will appear in Rolling Stone magazine on Friday.
In the eight-page article, released to reporters on Monday ahead of publication, McChrystal appears to belittle Vice President Joe Biden and accuses Karl Eikenberry, the U.S.
ambassador to Kabul, of undermining his war plan within the administration.
Asked by the Rolling Stone reporter about what he now feels of the war strategy advocated by Biden last fall — fewer troops, more drone attacks — the article reports that
McChrystal and his aides attempted to come up with a good one-liner to dismiss the question. "Are you asking about Vice President Biden?" McChrystal reportedly jokes. "Who's
that?"
Later in the article, McChrystal turns more serious when asked about cables sent last fall to Washington by Eikenberry. The cables called into question the major troop increase
advocated by McChrystal's team and the U.S.'s backing of Afghan President Hamid Karzai — views that the ambassador had not previously raised with McChrystal or his staff.
"I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said anything like that to us before," McChrystal is quoted as saying. "Here's one that covers his flank for the history
books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so."
The article, titled "The Runaway General," has already caused nervousness inside the Pentagon, where memories are still fresh of another blistering profile that got a top
commander in hot water: an August 2008 cover story in Esquire <hop://wvav.esquire.com/features/fox-fallon > on Adm. William "Fox" Fallon, then commander of all U.S.
forces in the Middle East and Central Asia. The article eventually played a part in Fallon's resignation two years ago.
In that Esquire piece, however, Fallon appeared to directly contradict White House policy on Iran and other parts of the Middle East; the Rolling Stone article makes no such
allegation, but rather is full of jokey put-downs of important Washington players.
Comments in the article attributed to anonymous McChrystal aides are particularly harsh towards some senior members of the Obama administration, including National Security
Adviser James Jones, and other leading politicians, like Sens. John Kerry (D., Mass.) and John McCain (R., Ariz). They also make some unflattering references to
PresidentBarack Obama himself, saying the president didn't seem to know who McChrystal was when he appointed him to run the war early last year.
Only Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is portrayed as having strongly backed McChrystal's plan for Afghanistan, is singled out for praise by the anonymous McChrystal

Top US Afghan commander mocks Biden: report
(AFP) — 1 hour ago
WASHINGTON — The US commander in Afghanistan mocks the vice president and denounces a top diplomat in a magazine interview, while his aides
speak dismissively of President Barack Obama.
Tensions between General Stanley McChrystal and the White House are on full display in an unflattering profile in Rolling Stone of the commander of US
and NATO forces in the Afghan war.
McChrystal jokes sarcastically about preparing to answer a question referring to Vice President Joe Biden, known as a skeptic of the commander's war
strategy.
"Are you asking about Vice President Biden?' McChrystal says with a laugh. 'Who's that?'" the article quotes him as saying.
"Biden?' suggests a top adviser. 'Did you say: Bite Me?"
McChrystal tells the magazine that he felt "betrayed" by the US ambassador to Kabul, Karl Eikenberry, in a White House debate over war strategy last year.
Referring to a leaked internal memo from Eikenberry that questioned McChrystal's request for more troops, the commander suggested the ambassador had
tried to protect himself for history's sake.
"I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said anything like that to us before," McChrystal tells the magazine.
"Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, ?I told you so."
Eikenberry, himself a former commander in Afghanisan, had written to the White House saying Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an unreliable partner
and that a surge of troops could draw the United States into a open-ended quagmire.
The article revisits the friction between the White House and the military last fall as Obama debated whether to grant McChrystal's request for tens of
thousands of reinforcements.
Although Obama in the end granted most of what McChrystal asked for, the strategy review was a difficult time, the general tells the magazine.
"I found that time painful," McChrystal says. "I was selling an unsellable position."
An unnamed adviser to McChrystal alleges the general came away unimpressed after a meeting with Obama in the Oval Office a year ago, just after the
president named him to take over in Afghanistan.
"It was a 10-minute photo op," the general's adviser says.
"Obama clearly didn?t know anything about him, who he was.., he didn?t seem very engaged.
"The boss was pretty disappointed," says the adviser.
The profile, titled "The Runaway General," portrays his aides as profane and intensely loyal to McChrystal, while arguing the general has seized control over
the war on the military and diplomatic fronts.
The four-star general also derides the hard-charging top US envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, and complains about a dinner with an unnamed French
minister during a visit to Paris.
"Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke," McChrystal says, looking at his messages on a mobile phone. "I don't even want to open it."
In a hotel room in Paris getting ready for a dinner with a French official, McChrystal says: "How'd I get screwed into going to this dinner?"
"The dinner comes with the position, sir," says his aide, Colonel Charlie Flynn.
"Hey, Charlie," McChrystal says, "does this come with the position?"
McChrystal gives him the middle finger.

The Runaway General
Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan,
has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the
real enemy: The wimps in the White House
By Michael Hastings
Jun 22, 2010 10:00 AM EDT
This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.
'Howed I get screwed into going to this dinner?"" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April,
and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in
Paris. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually
have allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United
States. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president
and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to
keep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.
"The dinner comes with the position, sir," says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.
McChrystal turns sharply in his chair.
"Hey, Charlie," he asks, "does this come with the position?"
McChrystal gives him the middle finger.
The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations
center. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet,
hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian
casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his
advisers says, is the "most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine." The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any
place with candles on the tables as too "Gucci." He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega
Nights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt
comfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the
Pentagon's most secretive black ops.
"What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car
bombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.
"We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed," Flynn says.
McChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in
Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up or
disappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.
"I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner," McChrystal says.
He pauses a beat.
"Unfortunately," he adds, "no one in this room could do it."
With that, he's out the door.
"Who's he going to dinner with?" I ask one of his aides.
"Some French minister," the aide tells me. "It's fucking gay."

The next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French
military academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes
with a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss
off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he
gave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as
"shortsighted," saying it would lead to a state of "Chaos-istan." The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president
himself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal
seemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile
Now, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get
today, and how he should respond. "I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem," he says.
Then, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-
liner.
"Are you asking about Vice President Biden?" McChrystal says with a laugh. "Who's that?"
"Biden?" suggests a top adviser. "Did you say: Bite Me?"
When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign
promise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. "I want the
American people to understand," he announced in March 2009. "We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle
and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan." He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since
the war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David
McKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had
met only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in
more than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.
Even though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The
general first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials
in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama
looked "uncomfortable and intimidated" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the
Oval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. "It was a 10-minute
photo op," says an adviser to McChrystal. "Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy
who's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed."
From the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a
controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the
Pentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of
fighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the
enemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — a
process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially
rebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:
Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his
"surge" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.
Nicknamed "COINdinistas" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution
for Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.
As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists
in Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.
After arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary
Robert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another
40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of "mission failure."
The White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak
on national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was
determined to kick the president's ass.
Last fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in
Afghanistan. "I found that time painful," McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. "I was selling an
unsellable position." For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against
experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in
Afghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. "The entire
COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people," says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading
critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. "The idea that we are going to spend a trillion
dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.
In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the
president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic
crisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.

Then, without ever using the words "victory" or "win," Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops
to Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,
behind the counterinsurgency crowd.
Today, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.
In June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions
of dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.
troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that
began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it
as a "bleeding ulcer." In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and
Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The
president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even
though it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he
didn't want.
Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to
accomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. "It's not going to look like a win, smell
like a win or taste like a win," says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. "This is going
to end in an argument."
The night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists,
around the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she
has seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has
invited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the "least Gucci" place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised.
"He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear," she says with a laugh.
The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.
There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two
fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as
Team America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves
on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about
changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had
taken to deriding ISAF as short for "I Suck at Fighting" or "In Sandals and Flip-Flops.") McChrystal banned alcohol on
base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands
of officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub
modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary
for sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend
around the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a
staple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man
single-handedly winning the war.
By midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps
from a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own
invention."Afghanistan!" they bellow."Afghanistan!" They call it their Afghanistan song.
McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. "All these men," he tells me. "I'd die for them. And they'd die
for me."
The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group
represents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable
command of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an
assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special
Representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into
the mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call
the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. "It jeopardizes the mission,"
says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. "The military cannot
by itself create governance reform."
Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State
Department receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit
about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and
veteran of the Cold War, a "clown" who remains "stuck in 1985." Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,
"turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk
shows. Frankly, it's not very helpful." Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. "Hillary
had Stan's back during the strategic review," says an adviser. "She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'"
McChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. "The Boss says
he's like a wounded animal," says a member of the general's team. "Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to

get fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp
onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit."
At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. "Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke," he groans. "I
don't even want to open it." He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in
his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.
"Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg," an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.
By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.
According to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and
2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by
NATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the
diplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively
increased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. "In reality, that position needs to be filled
by an American for it to have weight," says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.
The relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New
York Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's
strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as "not an adequate strategic partner," and cast doubt on whether the
counterinsurgency plan would be "sufficient" to deal with Al Qaeda. "We will become more deeply engaged here with no
way to extricate ourselves," Eikenberry warned, "short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and
chaos."
McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. "I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said
anything like that to us before," says McChrystal, who adds that he felt "betrayed" by the leak. "Here's one that covers his
flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'"
The most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not
diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead
Afghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered
credible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied
the president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.
In February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get
him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the
president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted
the aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.
This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government
puts us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his
cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. "He's been locked up in his
palace the past year," laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined
McChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.
soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. "General," he called out to McChrystal, "I didn't even know we were
fighting in Uruzgan!"
Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him
throughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all
joined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he
made no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a
fastball down the middle.
McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the
last to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The "Prison on the Hudson," as it was known then, was a
potent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,
and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called "rat fucking," which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or
mud, covered in shaving cream. "It was pretty out of control," says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to
serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls "huge talent" and
"wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism," also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.
forces in Iraq.
The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to
thrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more
than 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a
"century man." One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after
downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours
subjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. "I'd come visit, and I'd

end up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area," recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal
in 1973.
McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as
brilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary
magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his
career. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-
old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In "Brinkman's Note," a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator
appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the
assassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: "The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the
raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded."
After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. "We really
felt we were a peacetime generation," he recalls. "There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal."
So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental
commander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen
Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who
want to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers
outdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,
required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance
with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.
In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks
of humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as
a troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting
tossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that
followed September 11th. "He was very focused," says Annie. "Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he
wanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years."
By some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman
during the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander
with a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous "stuff happens"
remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission
Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —
overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part
in a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.
After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April
2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He
signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.
(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander
known for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,
specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. "If the circumstances of
Corporal Tillman's death become public," he wrote, it could cause "public embarrassment" for the president.
"The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions," wrote Tillman's mother,
Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the "golden
boy" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping
the chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.
Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in
Iraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of
abuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even
though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so
unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in
Afghanistan, viewing them as a "political swamp," according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for
his confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the
scandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in
Afghanistan.
The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a
dweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a "Jedi" commander, as Newsweek called
him. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor
rare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on
his iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name
and four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. ("There are no limits. There are only plateaus,
and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,
unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. "The fucking

lads love Stan McChrystal," says a British officer who serves in Kabul. "You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone
would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal."
It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite
forces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of
insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. "JSOC was a killing machine," says Maj. Gen.
Mayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist
networks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned
by the military. "The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,
sitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming," says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal
in Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. "He'd say, 'Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help.
You got to work together with these guys.'"
Even in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts
of a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from
four to 19. "You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight," McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the
hallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, "I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though." In fact, the general
frequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this
year, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created
tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special
Forces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests
erupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. "We've shot an amazing number of
people," McChrystal recently conceded.
Despite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that
the U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's "insurgent math," as he calls it — for every innocent person you
kill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air
power and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates
commanders responsible for civilian deaths. "For a while," says one U.S. official, "the most dangerous place to be in
Afghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident." The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make
not killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for "courageous restraint," a
buzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.
But however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own
troops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. "Bottom line?" says a former Special
Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. "I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of
engagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing."
In March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront
such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had
received an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.
"I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves," Arroyo
wrote.
Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: "I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers, as it is
something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend
upon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own." Then he showed up at Arroyo's
outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live
operation in a dangerous war zone.
Six weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-
old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED
a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general
would attend Ingram's memorial service. "He started to look up to you," Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to
make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.
The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM
to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard
towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen
some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had
repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a
combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been
denied. "These were abandoned houses," fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. "Nobody was coming back to live in them."
One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. "Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably
certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force," the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has
traveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't
have to make arrests. "Does that make any fucking sense?" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. "We should just drop a fucking
bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?"
The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of
command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. "Fuck, when I came over here and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
heard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on," says Hicks, who has served three tours
of combat. "I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his
bird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they're all fucked up — either because
somebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this
thing."
McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two
dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. "I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all to
understand the big picture as well," McChrystal begins. "How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for
yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?" McChrystal says.
"Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir," says Hicks.
McChrystal nods. "Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead," he tells the men. "You're leading by example.
That's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside." Then he spends 20 minutes talking about
counterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,
but he's careful not to bullshit the men. "We are knee-deep in the decisive year," he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no
longer has the initiative — "but I don't think we do, either." It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning any
hearts and minds among the soldiers. "This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks," McChrystal tries to joke.
"But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies."
During the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use
lethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they
did in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban," one soldier says.
"Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing," McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't
kill your way out of Afghanistan. "The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work."
"I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir," the soldier persists. "You say we've stopped the momentum of the
insurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it's
getting."
"I agree with you," McChrystal says. "In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,
you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out
here and resettle it?"
A soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a
civilian. "That's the way this game is," McChrystal says. "It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll kill
all the shirts."
As the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one
last-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. "There's no way I can make that easier," he tells
them. "No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you're doing a great job.
Don't let the frustration get to you." The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold
President Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren't buying it.
When it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here
was Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.
The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent
memory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).
McChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,
expensive and easy to lose. "Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan," he says. But even if he somehow manages to
succeed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to
shut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,
roads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying
Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. "It's all very cynical, politically," says Marc Sageman, a former CIA
case officer who has extensive experience in the region. "Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there's nothing for us
there."
In mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by
Hamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in
Kabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the
praises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian
casualties. They mention the word "progress" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the •
session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. "There is no
denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economic
development," the president says. "As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been
visible just a few years earlier."
It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no
real progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. "It was one of our first
impressions," one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. "So many
lights shining brightly." So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
progress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have
mocked. "They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even
defined or recognizable," says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political
adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. "That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is
to create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become
great in the near future."
But facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those
closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things
are in Afghanistan. "If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,"
a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from
dreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its
counterinsurgency campaign even further. "There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next
summer if we see success here," a senior military official in Kabul tells me.
Back in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of "progress,"
McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning
to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original
home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that
McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more
groundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like
Fallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a "rising tide of security." The Afghan police and
army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city
to win over the civilian population.
Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. "This isn't a classic operation," says a
U.S. military official. "It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in." Other U.S. officials
insist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.
"The Taliban have a jackboot on the city," says a military official. "We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way
that doesn't alienate the population." When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders
say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.
"This looks like CT-plus!" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.
Whatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years
of war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that
COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his
influence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things
worse. "Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem," says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who
has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. "A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government
and creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility
among the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the
primary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using
the word "victory" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with
Stanley McChrystal in charge.

The Empty Chamber
Just how broken is the Senate?
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration....
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

Cit and watch us for seven days,"" one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. "You know what you'll see happening?
Nothing."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015
'This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'"
Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.
"It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. "The obstructionism has become
mindless."
The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly
behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and
top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.
"Also, it's a dumb rule in itself," McCaskill said. "It's time we started looking at some of these rules."
She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and
subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had
scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general
and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and McCaskill's
Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training of Afghan
police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a victory
ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-care
reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most embarrassing
sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who had fought the
bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.
So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard
Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. "I have no personal objection to
continuing," Burr said. But, he added, "there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object."
Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In
general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be
present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their first
look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The
presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce them to
the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about the
Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, "Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the
floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're
doing in China right now?"
Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name every
few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the press
lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of interest
actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers. On this
afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the transcription
machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate chamber is an
intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.
Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to
hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some
built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority
and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,
"Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and not
be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule."
The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon; the
general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators these
days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-term
successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.
Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three
amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an
amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch the
amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was to
finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the only
thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty
minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to
yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,
would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.
Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, "This is the first time in recent memory
that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to kill the
reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are defeated."
Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. "The position on the other side
of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good," he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose
half an octave. "Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015
inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an
inconvenience."
The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded
Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to
emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides the
chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third
person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the
moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's "Manual of
Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from insulting
any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting at Al
Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make no mistake, the intent
of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform. . . . A senator on
the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill health-care
reform!"
The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: "The time of the senator has expired."
For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that happens
on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the Democrats
while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that it wouldn't
have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had been designed to
make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically supports. One
amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on individuals making less
than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and outlandish. David Vitter, a
Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican
obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with mental illness would not be
denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists, and sex offenders" from
buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was allotted to explain his Viagra
amendment without cracking a smile. "This is not a game amendment," he insisted. "It actually saves money."
So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate," Baucus declared. "It is a crass
political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy." Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr.
Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues
milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John McCain—
now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed, trying to catch
the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben Nelson, of
Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.
The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled drone
was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, "Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!" Sporadically, a
sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could charm into
laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo animals—Levin a
shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one displayed a limited set of
behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and clamped his hands down on a
colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which senators were loners (Russ
Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which senators were important (Dick
Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).
Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through
her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. "Can we
get some order?" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It
was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.
Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,
unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was
hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the chamber
to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow, of Michigan,
her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion momentarily
eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face, as if casting
her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, "The longest it lasted was thirty seconds."
At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just found
two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the bill would
go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the Capitol's

northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty streets.
On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if waiting for
someone to take him away.
The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the
Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. "Everyone's
tired," Reid declared before the final vote. "This legislative fight is one for the record books." He was so fatigued that he
initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. "Way to go, Lindsey, way to
stretch it out," Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the losing
team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a moment the
chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.
The Senate is often referred to as "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, "That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of
exchange of ideas, is so limited." Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a
Republican and a Democrat. "The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring in
which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber."
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.
"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue," he said.
Instead, a senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets
up and gives a speech on a completely different subject." From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a
colloquy—"I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage
plan"—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits
from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.
Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same
morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a hearing
can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an unwritten
rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows senators to spend
four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their families in their
home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless fund-raising, and
to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, in 1995, he
told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader, said,
"When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one hundred senators there
was Wednesday afternoon."
Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, "Of any free time
you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own
campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on
behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate
office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee
Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, "It sucks up time that a
senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues."
In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took time
to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a million
dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry groups
were spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-raising
and lobbying, said, "People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The over-all bills
are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money."
Deschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: "Sometimes, you're dialling for dollars,
you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the floor, your
staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double check—but,
just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye vote, or a no
vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up sometimes. But, if
you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope nobody asks, because
I don't have a clue."
Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past few
decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff members,
who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional relationships, tend to
push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiating
the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox' or MSNBC.
One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. "You know about all
these rags that cover the Hill, right?" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily,
and CQ Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of
the "24/7 media," provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a "dust-up" between Scott

Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South Carolina;
the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront DeMint on the
Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators have a young
press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of political
obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go unreported
because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to the Senate in
1981 and will leave next January, told me, "I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who covered me on a
daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications only see me
through the prism of conflict." Lamar Alexander described the effect as "this instant radicalizing of positions to the left and
the right."
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly
fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan coOperation is still
permissible. "A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution," Gregg said. "Substantive,
thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside."
Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus lunch
to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one
another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses
who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill
Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall has
set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the
seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: "In those days Democrats and
Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim
DeMint, Dodd said, "Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well." He repeated something that Jon
Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: "There's no trust." Dodd, whose father was a senator,
went on, "That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with that
conclusion. And if that's missing.
There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party as
"friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as "one of my best friends in the Senate," and
both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with
Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udall
noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But opportunities to
bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the "inner sanctum," where
Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the seventies, old bulls
such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. "You
learned, and also you found out what was going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult to say crappy things about
someone that you just had lunch with." These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch in their
respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else "downtown," which means asking donors for money over
steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the "caucus lunch" was instituted by Republicans in
the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches work
members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry
Reid as an idiot. "At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors," Alexander joked, adding, "We spend most of
our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other."
In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind of dwindled off during the
health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few
months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.
These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers
who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson, of
Wisconsin, put it this way: "Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?"
The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.
The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a
levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply
impressed by the quality of its members: "They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous instincts
animating it, not the petty passions." But he also recognized that "a minority of the nation dominating the Senate could
completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the spirit of
constitutional government." As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented statesmen,
Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.
Robert A. Caro, in "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War •
the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster, Henry
Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the Presidencies of
Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of Southern racists

and Republican corporate shills, and was "the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed themselves in vain—
the chief obstructive force in the federal government." By the fifties, the Senate had become far more conservative than
the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book "Citadel," called the Senate "to a most peculiar
degree, a Southern Institution . . . growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly" and "the only place in the
country where the South did not lose the war."
By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and
Consent," based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works, in
its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-raisers,
no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere is
based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand. . . . They thrust hard
at one another in debate over serious matters," but, he writes, "understanding and accommodation in the ordinary course
of the Senate day was essential to sanity." Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the Senate to his
will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either "whales"—the heavyweight chairmen who
negotiated legislation—or "minnows," the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when, in 1958, a
formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, and Philip
Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of "The Fall of the House of
Roosevelt," worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. "They used to talk to each other—that's my most
vivid recollection," he said. "If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners would come in to
hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a deliberative body,
drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically." Senators who ran for office in order to work on foreign policy, social
welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. "But if you wanted to do something there was a mechanism
by which you could do it," Janeway said.
In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and
moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of
those decades as "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the
Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,
campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed
jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was passed,
in 1965, it won 70-24.
The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,
Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan "field
hearings" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,
greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's
legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and
said, "You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's
how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You should become Mr. Housing.
Housing is the future."
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and
accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of
people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs," Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled. "They
were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to
Republicans in the Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,
who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, "It was a huge loss of the most experienced,
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there
less than six years." He added, "The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets
worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others
didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'"
After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals
began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," a recent book by the Washington Post
reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans
began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan
coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own
fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members
of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to
regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in
the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and
escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats
filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-
called "nuclear option." Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went to

South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years
earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.
The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,
independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that every
election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The Senate,
no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main action was
between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican Senate
majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.
Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly
become populated by "ideologues and charlatans." He went on, "When we do get good people who come in, they very
quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay
there." He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with
angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about "pulling the plug on
Grandma." Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin "altering his behavior and abandoning
every issue, including campaign-finance reform."
One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.
A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the
111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger
down the list of senators. He did it again. "I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this." He
was stumped. "Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time." He
put the directory aside. "I'm just having the damnedest time."
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was hired
last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, until
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became lobbyists.
In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned and formed
a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a two-year
waiting period between serving and lobbying.
When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute
thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), and
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where
senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over
the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.
Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices," which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was
known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding
officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.
After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's "Advise and Consent" is still faintly visible. "The Senate, by its
nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's
not changed." Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its
members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, "To have a chamber
that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please."
In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one
(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia; liberals,
like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of
Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of
senior senators. "If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry is they won't stay. Because it's not
productive."
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in 6 dynamic new era. Instead, their
young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and "secret holds"—when a senator
anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire
McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds, and
Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical gamesmanship
between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first year. Michael
Bennet said, "We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small ones, and where
things have been put off for a really long period of time." He mentioned the national debt, energy policy, and the financial
crisis. "Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it."

We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with bottled
water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was moving.
Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already has to
defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to grow too
attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard. about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: "And then some
more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.' As the fifteen
months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems."
Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,
Con gressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his•state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office
maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent several
days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of unemployed
Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually, Republicans persuaded
Bunning to stop.)
These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,
Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In
2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more
senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and their party leader facilitates the game by
keeping their names secret.
Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of
partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-
authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used rule
that allowed the "previous question" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by the
eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and talking
until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster' comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for "looter.")
In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a "cloture" vote. For decades, the rule was rarely
used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies and
eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower the
threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a year, as
both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the Republicans lost
their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture votes in 2007 and
2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, the outraged
Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. "Because they do not do their business in a way that facilitates
noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate." Last week, six House
Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to run
the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection was
substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and vote.
Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading aloud
of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist; Senate
clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in frustration.
Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first
proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues "nihilists," who want to create chaos because it
serves their ideology. "If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't listen
to reason." McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican strategy
reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, "To the extent that they"—the Democrats—
"want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be helpful. To the
extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful."
One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after vote.
Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana; Susan
Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus? Alexander
said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, "When you have your back against the wall and the gallows
are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind."

Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: "He said
if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant." Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster a
military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad
Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with
the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose cloture,
and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)
Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus
bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-care-
reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against the
version that went before the full Senate. "I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance Committee
version—it grew by a thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White House officials
that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices, and said that the Democrats "did not
accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch." McConnell was able to exploit her
alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: "She actually said to me once that she had never felt
the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to her or quite as real or
troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this together. You're a senior
Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and you're going to do it.' "
Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the senator
who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverage
of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.
In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per cent
of the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a few new
senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.
Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent
time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.
"I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas," he said. "Then to be on the inside—the thing
that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show."
In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.
Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend
them, making it extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII is a Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different
idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that "each House may determine the Rules
of its Proceedings" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January and
propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority. There's
even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three times,
most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.
At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings
on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized working
groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee chairs by
caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were competing
for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other for Majority
Leader.)
For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. "If you want a
parliamentary form of government, go over to the House," Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. "Why even run for the
Senate?" Udall's plan for next January, he said, would be a "gigantic mistake."
"They'll get over it," Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. "And they'll get over it quicker if they're
in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider whatever they
have to say." He added that the Senate "may be getting done about as much as the American people want done." The
President's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of the Republicans I
spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is "broken." Alexander claimed that he and other Republicans were
exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate. "The Senate wasn't
created to be efficient," he argued. "It was created to be inefficient." At one of the filibuster hearings, in April, Alexander,
sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the Republicans with obstructing
legislation, "we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our right to debate, our right to offer
amendments, which is the essence of the Senate."

Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah Binder,
a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the filibuster, and
so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding of the freshmen,
"These are people who have never been in the minority." For older Democrats, who have put in their years, grown adept
at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat. (Among senior senators,
the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being divided not between
whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too accustomed to the Senate's
ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate Republicans are too weak to challenge the
newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,
wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" and "generous impulses" have no place.
A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial
regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to
pass a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.
The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first
term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of
Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having to
do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They worked
through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were members of
a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke, Alan
Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still
talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, they had finished
their work.
Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,
dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the
committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed
McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. "It was an odd place to be," Corker recalled. "And yet that night we
began meeting." The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In
response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their lobbyists
that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other Republicans of the
Party's line on financial reform.)
On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, "You've been a great
partner." He was ending their talks after only a month. "It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest," Corker told reporters
afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the
rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks
under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other
Republicans with him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-
five Republican votes."
The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar fund,
paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of another crisis.
But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was now parroting
talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a "partisan bill" that "will guarantee
perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks." McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-one Republicans,
suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded
with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, "Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the rhetoric.
Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do. . . . We were supposed to be
the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat down with cooler
heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot do that on
financial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it . . ." Corker didn't allow the
thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.
Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: "I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I am
not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue . . . then why

are we even here?" He went on, "We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is looking out
for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority seems intent
on proving them right. . . . I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know there are friends
of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate, who want to be part of
the solution."
In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, "I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four or
five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it. . . . I have
to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!"
Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. "You and I went a long
way," Corker told Dodd. "Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats
on your committee."
"And I was not gaining Republicans," Dodd replied.
"You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did
not leave the table." Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few
days.
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-
reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists
prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the ornate
Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of furniture
scraping across a tile floor. "Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens around
here without a deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A few weeks
later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform finally came to a
vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He had even voted for
an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have scrapped Corker's work
of many months with Warner.
"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained
office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. "It's the Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy of obstruction
had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a "shrinking number" of Republicans were
frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, "God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking
member on this." Collins responded, "We could have had such a great time on this bill."
Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because "the American people don't trust either political party enough
to give them a blank check," was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. "There was zero
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes," he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the
bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, "If you want to vote against something, you
can always find your reasons."
But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating
himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of thirty
minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. "I am obviously disappointed," he said. "I think I have spent as
much time as any senator. . . on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good things in
it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not enough time
was spent on some of the core issues."
As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of "So Damn Much Money," in the press gallery. I later
asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of the
Senate. "If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away money
and interest groups," he said. "But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things
considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here
you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet."
After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,
smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, "For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it
didn't work." He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with "some Nevadans."
Durbin said, "I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?"
Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, "I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its
business much as our founders intended. We did that."
On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial
regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They
depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,
Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the year.
And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign finance,
transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial appointments on

the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you can feel the Senate
slipping back into stagnant waters.

The Political Scene
The Empty Chamber
Just how broken is the Senate?
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration....
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills
passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

""Sit and watch us for seven days," one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. "You know what you'll see happening?
Nothing."
"This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'"
Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.
"It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. "The obstructionism has become
mindless."
The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly
behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and
top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.
"Also, it's a dumb rule in itself," McCaskill said. "It's time we started looking at some of these rules."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and
subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had
scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general
and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and
McCaskill's Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training
of Afghan police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a
victory ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-
care reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most
embarrassing sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who
had fought the bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.
So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard
Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. "I have no personal objection to
continuing," Burr said. But, he added, "there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object."
Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In
general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be
present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their
first look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The
presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce
them to the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about
the Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, "Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the
floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're
doing in China right now?"
Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name
every few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the
press lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of
interest actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers.
On this afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the
transcription machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate
chamber is an intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.
Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to
hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some
built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority
and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,
"Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and
not be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule."
The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon;
the general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators
these days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-
term successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.
Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three
amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an
amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch
the amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was
to finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the
only thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty
minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to
yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,
would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.
Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, "This is the first time in recent
memory that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to
kill the reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are
defeated."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. "The position on the other side
of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good," he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose
half an octave. "Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an
inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an
inconvenience."
The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded
Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to
emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides
the chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third
person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the
moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's "Manual of
Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from
insulting any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting
at Al Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make no mistake, the
intent of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform.... A
senator on the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill
health-care reform!"
The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: "The time of the senator has expired."
For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that
happens on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the
Democrats while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that
it wouldn't have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had
been designed to make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically
supports. One amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on
individuals making less than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and
outlandish. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom
Coburn, a Republican obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with
mental illness would not be denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists,
and sex offenders" from buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was
allotted to explain his Viagra amendment without cracking a smile. "This is not a game amendment," he insisted. "It
actually saves money."
So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate," Baucus declared. "It is a crass
political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy." Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr.
Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues
milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John
McCain—now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed,
trying to catch the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben
Nelson, of Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.
The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled
drone was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, "Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!"
Sporadically, a sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could
charm into laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo
animals—Levin a shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one
displayed a limited set of behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and
clamped his hands down on a colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which
senators were loners (Russ Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which
senators were important (Dick Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).
Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through
her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. "Can we

get some order?" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It
was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.
Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,
unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was
hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the
chamber to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow,
of Michigan, her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion
momentarily eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face,
as if casting her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, "The longest it lasted was thirty
seconds."
At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just
found two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the
bill would go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the
Capitol's northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty
streets. On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if
waiting for someone to take him away.
The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the
Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. "Everyone's
tired," Reid declared before the final vote. "This legislative fight is one for the record books." He was so fatigued that he
initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. "Way to go, Lindsey, way
to stretch it out," Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the
losing team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a
moment the chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.
The Senate is often referred to as "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, "That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of
exchange of ideas, is so limited." Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a
Republican and a Democrat. "The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring
in which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber."
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.
"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue," he said.
Instead, a senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets
up and gives a speech on a completely different subject." From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a
colloquy—"I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage
plan"—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits
from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.
Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same
morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a
hearing can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an
unwritten rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows
senators to spend four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their
families in their home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless
fund-raising, and to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the
House, in 1995, he told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former
Democratic leader, said, "When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one
hundred senators there was Wednesday afternoon."
Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, "Of any free
time you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own
campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on
behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate
office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee

Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, "It sucks up time that a
senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues."
In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took
time to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a
million dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry
groups were spending $1.4 million.a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-
raising and lobbying, said, "People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The
over-all bills are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money."
Daschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: "Sometimes, you're dialling for
dollars, you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the
floor, your staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double
check—but, just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye
vote, or a no vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up
sometimes. But, if you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope
nobody asks, because I don't have a clue."
Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past
few decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff
members, who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional
relationships, tend to push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—
writing bills, negotiating the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox or MSNBC.
One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. "You know about all
these rags that cover the Hill, right?" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, CongressDaily,
and CO Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of
the "24/7 media," provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a "dust-up" between Scott
Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South
Carolina; the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront
DeMint on the Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators
have a young press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of
political obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go
unreported because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to
the Senate in 1981 and will leave next January, told me, "I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who
covered me on a daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications
only see me through the prism of conflict." Lamar Alexander described the effect as "this instant radicalizing of positions
to the left and the right."
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly
fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan cooperation is still
permissible. "A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution," Gregg said. "Substantive,
thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside."
Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus
lunch to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one
another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses
who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill
Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall
has set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the
seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: "In those days Democrats and
Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim
DeMint, Dodd said, "Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well." He repeated something that
Jon Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: "There's no trust." Dodd, whose father was a
senator, went on, "That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with
that conclusion. And if that's missing ... "
There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party
as "friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as "one of my best friends in the Senate,"
and both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with

Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining.
Udall noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But
opportunities to bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the "inner
sanctum," where Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the
seventies, old bulls such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan did. "You learned, and also you found out what was going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult to say
crappy things about someone that you just had lunch with." These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty.
Senators eat lunch in their respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else "downtown," which means
asking donors for money over steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the "caucus lunch"
was instituted by Republicans in the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980,
followed suit. Caucus lunches work members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican
lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry Reid as an idiot. "At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,"
Alexander joked, adding, "We spend most of our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other."
In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind of dwindled off during
the health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few
months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.
These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers
who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson,
of Wisconsin, put it this way: "Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?"
The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.
The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a
levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply
impressed by the quality of its members: "They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous
instincts animating it, not the petty passions." But he also recognized that "a minority of the nation dominating the
Senate could completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the
spirit of constitutional government." As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented
statesmen, Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.
Robert A. Caro, in "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War
the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster,
Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the
Presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of
Southern racists and Republican corporate shills, and was "the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed
themselves in vain—the chief obstructive force in the federal government." By the fifties, the Senate had become far
more conservative than the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book "Citadel," called the
Senate "to a most peculiar degree, a Southern Institution ... growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly"
and "the only place in the country where the South did not lose the war."
By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and
Consent," based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works,
in its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-
raisers, no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere is
based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand.... They thrust
hard at one another in debate over serious matters," but, he writes, "understanding and accommodation in the ordinary
course of the Senate day was essential to sanity." Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the
Senate to his will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either "whales"—the heavyweight
chairmen who negotiated legislation—or "minnows," the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when,
in 1958, a formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy,
and Philip Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of "The Fall of the
House of Roosevelt," worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. "They used to talk to each other—

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
that's my most vivid recollection," he said. "If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners
would come in to hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a
deliberative body, drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically." Senators who ran for office in order to work on
foreign policy, social welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. "But if you wanted to do something
there was a mechanism by which you could do it," Janeway said.
In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and
moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of
those decades as "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the
Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,
campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed
jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was
passed, in 1965, it won 70-24.
The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,
Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan "field
hearings" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,
greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's
legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and
said, "You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's
how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You should become Mr. Housing.
Housing is the future."
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and
accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of
people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs," Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled.
"They were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to
Republicans in the Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,
who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, "It was a huge loss of the most experienced,
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there
less than six years." He added, "The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets
worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others
didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'"
After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals
began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," a recent book by the Washington Post
reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans
began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan
coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own
fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members
of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to
regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in
the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and
escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats
filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-
called "nuclear option." Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went
to South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years
earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.
The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,
independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that
every election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The
Senate, no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main
action was between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican
Senate majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.
Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly
become populated by "ideologues and charlatans." He went on, "When we do get good people who come in, they very
quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
there." He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with
angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about "pulling the plug
on Grandma." Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin "altering his behavior and
abandoning every issue, including campaign-finance reform."
One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.
A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the
111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger
down the list of senators. He did it again. "I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this."
He was stumped. "Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time."
He put the directory aside. "I'm just having the damnedest time."
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was
hired last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, until
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became
lobbyists. In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned
and formed a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a
two-year waiting period between serving and lobbying.
When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute
thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), and
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where
senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over
the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.
Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices," which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was
known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding
officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.
After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's "Advise and Consent" is still faintly visible. "The Senate, by its
nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's
not changed." Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its
members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, "To have a chamber
that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please."
In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one
(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia;
liberals, like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of
Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of
senior senators. "If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry is they won't stay. Because it's
not productive."
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in a dynamic new era. Instead, their
young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and "secret holds"—when a senator
anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire
McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds,
and Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical
gamesmanship between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first
year. Michael Bennet said, "We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small
ones, and where things have been put off for a really long period of time." He mentioned the national debt, energy
policy, and the financial crisis. "Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it."
We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with
bottled water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
moving. Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already
has to defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to
grow too attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: "And
then some more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.'
As the fifteen months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems."
Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,
CongressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office
maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent
several days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of
unemployed Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually,
Republicans persuaded Bunning to stop.)
These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,
Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In
2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more
senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and their party leader facilitates the game by
keeping their names secret.
Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of
partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-
authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used
rule that allowed the "previous question" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by
the eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and
talking until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster" comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for "looter.")
In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a "cloture" vote. For decades, the rule was
rarely used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies
and eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower
the threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a
year, as both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the
Republicans lost their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture
votes in 2007 and 2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills
passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, the
outraged Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. "Because they do not do their business in a way that
facilitates noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate." Last week, six
House Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to
run the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection
was substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and
vote. Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading
aloud of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist;
Senate clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in
frustration.
Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first
proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues "nihilists," who want to create chaos because
it serves their ideology. "If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't
listen to reason." McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican
strategy reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, "To the extent that they"—the

Democrats—"want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be
helpful. To the extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful."
One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after
vote. Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana;
Susan Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus?
Alexander said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, "When you have your back against the wall and
the gallows are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind."
Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: "He said
if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant." Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster
a military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad
Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with
the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose
cloture, and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)
Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus
bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-
care-reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against
the version that went before the full Senate. "I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance
Committee version—it grew by a thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White
House officials that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices, and said that the
Democrats "did not accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch." McConnell
was able to exploit her alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: "She actually said to me once
that she had never felt the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to
her or quite as real or troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this
together. You're a senior Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and
you're going to do it.'"
Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the
senator who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverage
of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.
In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per
cent of the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a
few new senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.
Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent
time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.
"I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas," he said. "Then to be on the inside—the
thing that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show."
In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.
Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend
them, making it extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII is a Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different
idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that "each House may determine the
Rules of its Proceedings" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January
and propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority.
There's even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three
times, most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.
At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings
on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized
working groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
chairs by caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were
competing for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other
for Majority Leader.)
For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. "If you want a
parliamentary form of government, go over to the House," Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. "Why even run for the
Senate?" Udall's plan for next January, he said, would be a "gigantic mistake."
"They'll get over it," Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. "And they'll get over it quicker if
they're in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider
whatever they have to say." He added that the Senate "may be getting done about as much as the American people
want done." The President's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of
the Republicans I spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is "broken." Alexander claimed that he and other
Republicans were exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate.
"The Senate wasn't created to be efficient," he argued. "It was created to be inefficient." At one of the filibuster
hearings, in April, Alexander, sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the
Republicans with obstructing legislation, "we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our
right to debate, our right to offer amendments, which is the essence of the Senate."
Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah
Binder, a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the
filibuster, and so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding of
the freshmen, "These are people who have never been in the minority." For older Democrats, who have put in their
years, grown adept at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat.
(Among senior senators, the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being
divided not between whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too
accustomed to the Senate's ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate
Republicans are too weak to challenge the newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,
wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" and "generous impulses" have no place.
A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial
regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to pass
a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.
The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first
term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of
Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having
to do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They
worked through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were
members of a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke,
Alan Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still
talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, they had finished
their work.
Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,
dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the
committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed
McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. "It was an odd place to be," Corker recalled. "And yet that night we
began meeting." The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In
response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
lobbyists that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other
Republicans of the Party's line on financial reform.)
On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, "You've been a great
partner." He was ending their talks after only a month. "It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest," Corker told reporters
afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the
rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks
under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other
Republicans with him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-
five Republican votes."
The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar
fund, paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of
another crisis. But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was
now parroting talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a "partisan bill"
that "will guarantee perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks." McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-
one Republicans, suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded
with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, "Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the
rhetoric. Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do.... We were
supposed to be the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat
down with cooler heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot
do that on financial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it ..." Corker didn't
allow the thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.
Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: "I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I
am not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue ... then
why are we even here?" He went on, "We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is
looking out for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority
seems intent on proving them right.... I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know
there are friends of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate,
who want to be part of the solution."
In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, "I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four
or five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it.... I
have to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!"
Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. "You and I went a long
way," Corker told Dodd. "Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats
on your committee."
"And I was not gaining Republicans," Dodd replied.
"You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did
not leave the table." Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few
days.
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-
reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists
prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the
ornate Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of
furniture scraping across a tile floor. "Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens
around here without a deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A
few weeks later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform
finally came to a vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He
had even voted for an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have
scrapped Corker's work of many months with Warner.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained
office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. "It's the Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy of obstruction
had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a "shrinking number" of Republicans were
frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, "God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking
member on this." Collins responded, "We could have had such a great time on this bill."
Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because "the American people don't trust either political party
enough to give them a blank check," was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. "There was zero
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes," he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the
bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, "If you want to vote against something,
you can always find your reasons."
But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating
himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of
thirty minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. "I am obviously disappointed," he said. "I think I have
spent as much time as any senator.
... on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good
things in it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not
enough time was spent on some of the core issues."
As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of "So Damn Much Money," in the press gallery. I
later asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of
the Senate. "If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away
money and interest groups," he said. "But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things
considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here
you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet."
After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,
smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, "For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it
didn't work." He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with "some Nevadans."
Durbin said, "I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?"
Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, "I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its
business much as our founders intended. We did that."
On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial
regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They
depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,
Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the
year. And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign
finance, transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial
appointments on the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you
can feel the Senate slipping back into stagnant waters.

including AJ English Managing Director Tony Burman. We expect 7 people on the Al side and 6 on ours. (The dinner is
schedule for 8pm in a private room in the Four Seasons; post is making reservations for the party to stay in the same
hotel.)
Meeting with AJ Board Members at AJ Headquarters: This will give you an opportunity to engage the Qatari leadership
of the network. Discussions topics should include the mid-May Washington visit by some Al Board representatives. We
expect Wadah Khanfar to also participate in this meeting.
(TBC) Meeting with Prime Minister Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani (HBJ): As PM, HBJ is the ultimate Qatari authority
on Al. The meeting will also allow you to raise bi-lateral engagement issues as necessary. We expect to know in a few
days if HBJ will be available.
Meetings with CENTCOM: You will meet with CENTCOM staff at Al Udeid airbase just outside of Doha. They will brief
you on their .within their AOR, but with particular focus on activities in B1

Summit. We can expect you to also get questions on PD programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. You will be
interviewed by one of Al's "top" journalists; exactly who is still to be determined. The interview will be in English with
simultaneous interpretation into Arabic. It will likely air a number of times on AJ.
Feature on AJ English: This would be a second 15 minute "feature" piece similar to the one for Al Arabic. If we are
pressed for time we can consider just doing the Al Arabic feature.
Roundtable with local Qatari media: This will include journalists from a number of local Qatari media outlets. This is
another opportunity to talk about the Administration's commitment to engagement, but with a more targeted focus on
bilateral engagement and exchange programs.
Note — Wadah Khanfar has been closely engaged on, if not driving, the portions of your program that deal with Al. Post
reports that he is very pleased to have this opportunity for you to engage with Al leadership in Doha.

The Unnecessary Fall
A counter-history of the Obama presidency.
• John B. Judis
• August 12, 2010 I 12:00 am
On April 14, 2009, as Barack Obama's standing in the polls was beginning to slip, and as Tea Party demonstrators were
amassing in Washington for tax day protests, the president gave a lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining the
""five pillars" of his economic policies. The speech was intended to promote a memorable slogan for Obama's program that
would evoke comparisons with Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and Lyndon Johnson's
Great Society.
Obama's contribution was to be the New Foundation. "We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity—a
foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest," he declared. Obama
would repeat the phrase seven times that day and on many more occasions over the next months. At Obama's private
White House dinner with presidential historians that June, the historians were no more impressed than the public with
the New Foundation as a slogan. "I don't think it's going to work," Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said it
sounded "like a woman's girdle."
One of these historians might have been able to forewarn Obama that the slogan had been unsuccessfully deployed by a
Democratic president once before. In his 1979 State of the Union address, Jimmy Carter began, "Tonight, I want to
examine in a broad sense the state of our American Union—how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a
prosperous world." Carter would use the phrase five times in the speech, including in its conclusion, where he asked
members of Congress to join him "in building that new foundation." Like Obama's effort, the phrase inspired, at most, a
few underwear jokes and was then forgotten.
Obama's evocation of Carter was obviously unintended—but the Man from Plains is indeed the specter now hanging over
his presidency. Of course, Obama has already accomplished more in his first 20 months than Jimmy Carter did during his
entire presidency. But there is a disturbing political resemblance between the two presidencies. Both men ran inspired
campaigns in which they positioned themselves above the scandals and partisan quarrels of their predecessors and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
initially stirred hopes of a "transformational" presidency. But, as presidents, both men somehow failed to connect with
large parts of the electorate.
To be sure, there are a number of very specific reasons why Carter and Obama landed in political trouble. Both men
contended with rising unemployment—Carter with rampant inflation as well—and voters' approval of a president and his
party tend to track closely with changes in the economy. Carter faced friction in his own party and the rise of a powerful
business lobby, and Obama has dealt with a Republican Party that has frustrated his dreams of a post-partisan presidency.
Yet the most important reason for their difficulties—evident in their inept attempts to brand their programs—has been an
inability to develop a politics that resonates with the public.
In the United States, politics pivots around the allegiance of the middle class, even as its identity has changed from
yeoman farmers and mechanics to store clerks, office workers, x-ray technicians, and small business owners. They are, in
Bill Clinton's words, "those who work hard and play by the rules." They are the central characters in a populist rhetoric
that goes back to the early republic. It depicts the middle class as embattled and threatened either from forces below
(impoverished immigrants, welfare cheaters, ghetto rioters) or above (Wall Street speculators, state bureaucrats, K Street
lobbyists). Populism can be embraced by Glenn Beck or Tom Harkin. It is intrinsically neither left-wing nor right-wing.
Politicians, such as Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan, who found a way of using populism's appeal during downturns
have enjoyed success, while those who have spurned it have suffered accordingly. If, in circumstances like the present one,
you don't develop a populist politics, your adversaries will use populism to define you as an enemy of the people. That's
what Carter discovered during the stagflation of the late '70s. And that's what has happened in the last 20 months of the
Great Recession to Barack Obama and to the Democratic Party he leads.
Obama took office with widespread popular support, even among Republicans, and some of his first efforts, including the
$800 billion stimulus, initially enjoyed strong public favor. But that wide appeal began to dissipate by the late spring of
2009. Disillusion with Obama fueled the November defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and
Virginia. By January 2010, it was a crucial factor in Republican Scott Brown's astonishing victory over Martha Coakley in
Massachusetts.
In the postmortem debate over these defeats, some Democrats have blamed Obama's dogged pursuit of health care reform
while the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. That may have been a factor, but the real damage was done earlier. What
doomed Obama politically was the way he dealt with the financial crisis in the first six months of his presidency. In an
atmosphere primed for a populist backlash, he allowed the right wing to define the terms.
As Obama was delivering his inaugural address, the financial crisis was already in full swing; and it was already apparent
that financial speculation, outright fraud, and irresponsible and sometimes illegal housing-loan practices had played a
very large role in precipitating the crisis. The public was up in arms. But, instead of rallying the public against the "money
changers," as Roosevelt had done in his first inaugural, Obama, taking a leaf from Jimmy Carter's infamous "malaise"
speech, put the blame on the public as a whole. "Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and
irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new
age," he declared.
Over the next month, Obama would periodically criticize bankers after embarrassing revelations—at various times calling
the bonuses they gave themselves "shameful" and an "outrage"—but, after hearing complaints about his rhetoric from the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
bankers, he would back off. At a private meeting on March 28 with 13 Wall Street CEOs, the president, his spokesman
Robert Gibbs said, "emphasized that Wall Street needs Main Street and Main Street needs Wall Street." And, in his
Georgetown speech, Obama returned to his theme of collective responsibility. The recession, Obama said, "was caused by
a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main
Street."
Obama's policy followed the same swerving course as his rhetoric. One week, he would favor harsh restrictions on bank
and insurance-company bonuses, but, the next week, he would waver; one week, he would support legislation allowing
bankruptcy judges to reduce the amount that homeowners threatened with foreclosure owed the banks; the next week, he
would fail to protest when bank lobbyists pressured the Senate to kill these provisions. But, more importantly, Obama—in
sharp contrast to Roosevelt in his first months—failed to push Congress to immediately enact new financial regulations or
even to set up a commission to investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed a commission in July 2009, Obama
and his party put a milquetoast Democratic politician, former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides, in charge of it.)
Obama's appointments also conveyed an impression that he wanted to let Wall Street off the hook. He appointed Timothy
Geithner to be treasury secretary. Geithner claimed that he was not part of Wall Street, but, in his capacity as president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he had served under a board of directors headed by JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie
Dimon. As New York Fed president, Geithner had been partly responsible for the decision to let Lehman Brothers go
under, for the unpopular tarp program, and for American International Group (MG) paying back its Wall Street creditors
with government money. Geithner chose as his chief of staff a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs. Retiring Democratic
Senator Byron Dorgan told me, "Most Americans were reading about the massive compensations and bailouts, and the
administration largely hired people from the culture of Wall Street."
By the spring, Obama's apparent tilt to Wall Street had sparked a right-wing populist revolt in the country. The newly
formed Tea Party movement, Beck and Fox News, and a host of right-wing bloggers were leading the charge; but, in a less
extreme form, the general public shared their anger. In an early April New York Times/CBS News poll, the public
disapproved of Obama's aiding the banks by 58 percent to 33 percent. In this same poll, public approval of Obama's
handling of the economy began to fall. Pollsters who did focus groups also traced disillusionment with Obama's economic
policies to his handling of the financial crisis.
Congressman Barney Frank, who defends Obama's policies, acknowledges that the president's political difficulties began
with the revelation that MG, which had received $170 billion from the government, had paid out $165 billion in bonuses
to the division that had brought the company down. Geithner had known about the bonuses but insisted there were no
legal grounds to block them. (It then came out that Geithner had pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris
Dodd to insert a provision in the stimulus bill that protected the bonuses.) "The pitchforks were out. It added injury to
injury," Frank says. That's when public opinion of Geithner plummeted. According to a Rasmussen poll, 24 percent had a
favorable view of Geithner and 44 percent an unfavorable one.
The public's view of the bank bailout and the AIG bonuses colored its view of the auto bailout, the stimulus, and health
care reform. One of the rallying cries for the populist opposition to Obama was "where's my bailout?" (Obama himself
acknowledged that it was "one of the most frequent questions" he was asked in letters.) The auto program became a
bailout for the Big Three CEOs; the stimulus became a bailout of government itself; and health care reform was a bailout
for the uninsured—or "reparations," as Rush Limbaugh put it. Wrote right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin, "hardworking
citizens were getting sick of being played for chumps" by "moochers, big and small, corporate and individual, trampling
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
over themselves with their hands out demanding endless bailouts." Obama and the Democrats were successfully portrayed
as aiding "the moochers," but not the "hardworking citizens." In American politics, that's a recipe for political disaster.
Some in the White House political operation recognized in the late spring that the administration's economic efforts were
being defined by right-wing populism and tried to push Obama to take a more populist tack. A group within the White
House began calling themselves the "pitchfork gang," but they would find their attempts to convince Obama to get tough
on Wall Street or on insurance companies undermined by Geithner and by National Economic Council head Larry
Summers, who were worried about upsetting business confidence. "There was a continual tension in the White House,"
says a person who was privy to the discussions. "One week, we would be very hot, and then, the next week, we would dial it
back."
By early January of this year, Obama was clearly losing the battle for the middle class. According to a CNN poll, 60 percent
of Americans thought Obama "had paid more attention to the problems faced by banks and other financial institutions"
than to the "problems faced by middle class Americans." Only 28 percent, barely more than a quarter, thought he had paid
more attention to the middle class. As Brown surged ahead of Coakley in the polls, the White House temporarily embraced
a populist approach. On January 14, Obama called the bank bonuses "obscene" and said, "we want our money back." In a
January 22 speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio (a far cry from Georgetown), Obama used the
word "fighting" 13 times and "fight" nine times. "I will not stop fighting for you," he declared.
But, faced with a falling stock market and anger from Wall Street, Obama once again turned conciliatory. On February io,
he said that he didn't "begrudge" the $17 million bonus awarded to Dimon and the $9 million to Goldman Sachs CEO
Lloyd Blankfein. "I know both guys. They are very savvy businessmen."
Obama's reluctance to rail against Wall Street might have led to a watered-down financial reform bill, or even no bill at all,
but, on April 16, the Securities and Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs for fraud. The next week, an
emboldened Obama went to New York to criticize the bankers directly for their "failure of responsibility." As a result of the
indictment and Obama's rediscovery of his anger, Republicans became somewhat less obstructionist, moderate
Republicans broke with the party's leadership, and moderate Democrats fell into line. Congress produced a much stronger
bill than the Democrats had ever expected.
But Obama's embrace of populism has remained fitful and sporadic. After the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Verizon's
Ivan Seidenberg, the head of the Business Roundtable, criticized Obama for being anti-business in June, the president
dispatched Geithner, White House aide Valerie Jarrett, and Bill Clinton to appease the business community. Obama has
said enough to anger the CEOs, but he has failed to convey to the greater public that he is fighting for them.
Obama's unwillingness to buck Wall Street and the Business Roundtable, along with his delayed and muddled response to
the BP disaster in the Gulf, has eroded the public's confidence in his leadership. In Pew's midyear report card on Obama's
image, the greatest drop from February 2009 to this June was in the perception of Obama as a "strong leader." Voters will
sometimes tolerate policies they question from presidents like John Kennedy or Reagan, whom they regard as "strong,"
but not from politicians like Jimmy Carter, whom they regard as weak.
What of the other factors behind Obama's political difficulties? There is no doubt that, if the economy were growing faster,
and if unemployment were dropping below 9 percent, Obama and the Democrats would be more popular and not fearing a

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
November rout. But, unfortunately, the economy's sluggish recovery cannot be completely disentangled from the White
House's weak political performance.
In January, when the White House debated how large a stimulus to propose, Christina Romer, the head of the Council of
Economic Advisors, proposed a $1.2 trillion Keynesian jolt. David Obey, the chairman of the House Budget Committee,
told The Fiscal Times that Obama's Treasury Department asked initially for a $1.4 trillion bill. But the administration
finally proposed a stimulus between $700 and $800 billion that included large tax cuts that were more likely to stimulate
saving than consumption—and spending that would be unlikely to produce many jobs until the end of Obama's first term.
In the stimulus's first year, the administration spent only $17 billion of the $139 billion allocated for
infrastructure spending.
Prominent economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, made the case that a much larger stimulus was
necessary to reverse (rather than merely reduce) the rise in unemployment, and that, if a modest stimulus failed to reduce
unemployment, Republicans would convince the public that the stimulus was toxic medication and would block additional
Keynesian measures. That argument has been proven sadly correct. Some White House advisers appear to have
underestimated the depth of the Great Recession. Others seem to have doubted the administration had the political clout
to get more from Congress.
But the White House might have gotten more if Obama had proclaimed a national economic emergency (which it was);
framed the issue in terms of rescuing the middle class from damage done by Wall Street speculators, short-sighted CEOs,
and Chinese mercantilism; and directly attacked Republicans as heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly made
this sort of case on the eve of the financial reform vote this year, he got a much stronger bill than anyone had anticipated.
So it's not clear that the failure to get a larger stimulus—which has ended up hurting the administration politically—wasn't
itself a result of political timidity.
The president has also suffered from an inability to explain to the public why he sought such a large stimulus and what he
thought it could accomplish. Obama's New Foundation speech at Georgetown was soon forgotten. Afterward, Obama, to
the dismay of Democrats in Congress and some of his White House aides, pretty much dropped the jobs issue. From then
to Labor Day, he devoted a July visit to Buffalo and an August stopover in southern Indiana to the issue—at a time when
the right wing was mobilizing against him. Obama didn't just fail to develop a consistent narrative about the economy; he
didn't really try.
Contrast Obama's attempt to develop a politics to justify his economic program with what Reagan did in 1982. Faced with
steadily rising unemployment, which went from 8.6 percent in January to 10.4 percent in November, Reagan and his
political staff, which included James Baker, Mike Deaver, and Ed Rollins, forged a strategy early that year calling for
voters to "stay the course" and blaming the current economic troubles on Democratic profligacy. "We are clearing away
the economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps," Reagan declared. Democrats accused them of playing "the blame
game," but the strategy, followed to the letter by the White House for ten months, worked. The Republicans were
predicted to lose as many as 50 House seats, but they lost only 26 and broke even in the Senate.
Some commentators have noted Reagan's popularity was even lower than Obama's. But, on key economic questions, he
did much better than Obama and the Democrats are currently performing—and voters expressed far greater patience with
Reagan's program. According to polls, even as the unemployment rate climbed, a narrow plurality still expressed
confidence that Reagan's program would help the economy. On the eve of the election, with the unemployment rate at a
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
postwar high, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 6o percent of likely voters thought Reagan's economic
program would eventually help the country. That's a sign of a successful political operation. If Obama could command
those numbers, Democrats could seriously limit their losses in November. But Obama has not been able to develop a
narrative that could convince people to trust him and the Democrats.
Why has the White House failed to convince the public that it is fighting effectively on its behalf? The principal culprit is
clearly Barack Obama. He has a strange aversion to confrontational politics. His aversion is strange because he was
schooled in it, working as a community organizer in the 198os, under the tutelage of activists who subscribed to teachings
of the radical Saul Alinsky. But, when Obama departed for Harvard Law School in 1988, he left Alinsky and adversarial
tactics behind.
The young lawyer who returned to Chicago and won a seat in the Illinois state Senate in 1996 practiced a very different
style of politics. Obama's principal accomplishments in Springfield were bills restricting lobbying and requiring
videotaping of confessions in potential death penalty cases. He was not a typical blue-collar, bread-and-butter Chicago
Democrat, but the kind of good government liberal that represents the upscale districts of the city, seeing in politics a
higher calling and ill at ease with (although not in open opposition to) the city's Democratic machine. He was also a post-
racial politician who eschewed the hard-edged, angry rhetoric of Jesse Jackson. (That, too, is oddly reminiscent of Carter,
who partly campaigned in 1976 as the white Southern antidote to George Wallace's angry racial populism.)
Obama carried this outlook into the U.S. Senate, into his campaign for the presidency, and then, into the presidency itself.
He is a cerebral, dispassionate, post-partisan; he wants to "end the political strategy that has been based on division," to
"turn the page" on the culture wars of the 1960s and the partisan battles of the 1990s. During the campaign, his aides
jokingly referred to him as the "black Jesus." While he can tolerate and even brush aside conflict, he is reluctant to actively
foment it. "In a time of crisis, we can't afford to govern out of anger," he declared in February 2009. During his campaign
and his first year in office, he held to a blind faith in bipartisanship, even as the Republicans voted as a bloc against his
legislation. He is, perhaps, ill-suited in these respects for an era of bruising political warfare.
His advisers have clearly reinforced these inclinations. In the campaign, they fashioned him as the outsider candidate of
"hope" and "change" and have extended this strategy into the presidency itself. They see him as standing above party. In a
meeting with congressional leaders last April, senior adviser David Axelrod rejected the complaint that Obama accorded
equal blame to Democrats and Republicans with his descriptions of the "cynical politics in Washington." Within the White
House, top aides still speak of promoting the Obama "brand." Organizing for America, the administration's campaign
organization, which is supposed to be focusing on the 2010 elections, recently devoted its resources to organizing parties
across the country to celebrate Obama's forty-ninth birthday.
These efforts to elevate Obama above the hurly-burly of Washington politics have been disastrous. Obama's image as an
iconic outsider has become the screen on which Fox News, the Tea Party, radicalright bloggers, and assorted politicians
have projected the image of him as a foreigner, an Islamic radical, and a socialist. He has remained "the other" that he
aspired to be during the campaign, but he and his advisers no longer control how that otherness is defined.
The White House and cabinet officials he appointed have reinforced his aversion to populism. As Jonathan Alter recounts
in The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Geithner and Summers repeatedly blocked attempts to get tough on Wall
Street on the grounds that doing so would threaten the recovery itself by upsetting the bankers. For most of his first year,
Alter writes, "Obama bought the Geithner-Summers argument that the banks were fragile and couldn't be confronted
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
while they remained in peril." Its reluctance to come down on the bankers crippled the administration politically, making
it far more difficult for it to get its way with Congress on a second stimulus program that would have boosted the recovery
and Democrats' political prospects. Bad politics can trump good policy.
Populism has profound shortcomings as a worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In its relentless focus on the middle
class, it can ignore or stigmatize those below it. It can prove hostile to a long-range scientific outlook. A more populist
Obama, for instance, might have postponed the battle for climate change legislation or national health insurance and
probably would have taken a weaker stand on immigration. But populism has been an indelible part of the American
political psyche, and those who are uncomfortable making populist appeals, like Hoover or Carter—or, more recently,
presidential candidate John Kerry—suffer the consequences at the polls.
If Obama's politics leads to a Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress, and even to a Republican president
in 2012, then much of what Obama has accomplished could be undone. It's unlikely that a new Republican president and
Congress would actually repeal the health care or the financial reform bill. But the former could be starved of public funds
and deprived of regulatory oversight; and the latter could be neutered by a hostile treasury secretary and by weak or
hostile presidential appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the new Consumer Financial Protection
Agency. Reform legislation needs administrations and congresses committed to reform. That is where politics has to come
in; and that's where the Obama administration, with its aversion to populism, has fallen short.

The military and the mullahs
William Dalrymple
Published 23 August 2010
The Pakistani state has a long history of nurturing jihadis as a means of dominating Afghanistan and undermining India.
It is proving a fatal alliance.
It May have been a nightmarish year for Pakistan but it has been a pretty good one for the country's inscrutable chief of
army staff, the most powerful man in the Land of the Pure, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.
For a start, the army's response to the floods has compared well to the usual corrupt incompetence of Pakistan's civilian
politicians, guided by their chateau-hopping president, Asif Ali Zardari (while minister for investment, he was nicknamed
""Mr 10 Per Cent"; he has now been upgraded to "Mr 110 Per Cent"). This has led to discussion in army circles about
whether it is time to drop the civilian fig leaf and return the country to the loving embrace of its military. So serious is this
threat, that one of the country's most senior and well-connected journalists. Najam Sethi, editor-in-chief of the Friday
Times, went on the record this month to warn that elements in the army were plotting yet another coup."( know this is
definitely being discussed," he said.
Then there was the news that Kayani was going to be allowed to keep his job for a second term: "an extraordinary
situation requires an extraordinary decision to overcome it", explained a brigadier, writing in the Nation newspaper.
Kayani, a former head of Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO, can now continue
to run the army, and by default Pakistan's foreign policy, until November 2013.
But Kayani's biggest triumph this year, arguably the greatest of his career, was his visit to Kabul in July as the honoured
guest of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. The visit marked an important thawing in Pak-Afghan relations, which
have been glacial ever since Karzai came to power in 2001. It also coincided with the sacking of Amrullah Saleh,
Karzai's pro-Indian and rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh is a tough Tajik who rose to prominence as a
mujahedin protege of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Indian-backed "Lion of Panjshir". The Taliban, and their sponsors in
the ISI, had regarded Saleh as their fiercest opponent, something Saleh was enormously proud of.
When I had dinner with him in Kabul in May, he spoke at length of his frustration with the ineffectiveness of Karzai's
government in taking the fight to the Taliban, and the extent to which the ISI was managing to aid, arm and train its
puppet insurgents in North Waziristan and Balochistan. Saleh's sacking gave notice of an important change of direction
by Karzai. As Bruce Riedel, Barack Obama's Af-Pak adviser, said when the news broke, "it means that Karzai is already
planning for a post-American Afghanistan". •
It seems that Kayani and Karzai are discussing some sort of accommodation between the Afghan government and ISI-
sponsored elements in the Taliban, maybe those of Sirajuddin Haqqani, which could give over much of the Pashtun
south to pro-Pakistan Taliban, but preserve Karzai in power in Kabul after the US withdrawal. The expulsion of India,
Pakistan's great regional rival, from Afghanistan, or at least the closing of its four regional consulates, would be a top
priority for the ISI in return for any deal that kept Karzai in power.
With the US toppling of the Taliban after the 11 September 2001 attacks, Pakistan's influence disappeared abruptly from
Afghanistan and
India quickly filled the vacuum. To the ISI's horror, in the early years of this decade, India provided reconstruction
assistance and training worth roughly £835m in total. It also built roads, sanitation projects, the new Afghan parliament
and free medical facilities across the country. It even offered to help train the Afghan army. Nato refused. As General

Stanley McChrystal put it in a report last year, "while Indian activities largely benefit the Afghan people, increasing Indian
influence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani countermeasures".
McChrystal was right. The Pakistanis have always been paranoid about the small Indian presence in Afghanistan. "We
have strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan against Pakistan's interests to destabilise Pakistan," a foreign
ministry spokesman claimed in March. Pakistan's military establishment, terrified of the economic superpower emerging
to the south, believes it would be suicide to accept an Indian presence in what it regards as its Afghan backyard - a
potential point of retreat for the army in the event of an Indian invasion, something Pakistani analysts refer to as vital
"strategic depth".
According to Indian diplomatic sources, there are still fewer than 3,600 Indians in Afghanistan; there are only ten Indian
diplomatic officers, as opposed to nearly 150 in the UK embassy. Yet the horror of being encircled has led the ISI to risk
Pakistan's relationship with its main strategic ally, the US, in order to keep the Taliban in play and its leadership under
ISI patronage in Quetta - a policy Kayani developed while head of the IS!. Karzai's new deal with the Pakistanis, and his
clear intention to try to reach some accommodation with their proxies among the Taliban, therefore represents a major
strategic victory for Kayani and Pakistan's military, as well as a grave diplomatic defeat for India.
Pakistan's support for the Taliban today is only the most recent chapter of an old story of complicity between jihadi
movements and the Pakistani state. Since the days of the anti-Soviet mujahedin, Pakistan's army saw violent Islamic
groups as an ingenious and cost-effective means of both dominating Afghanistan (which they finally achieved with the
retreat of the Soviets in 1987) and bogging down the Hindu-dominated Indian army in Kashmir (which they managed
with great effect from 1990 onwards).
The former ISI director and Dick Dastardly lookalike Hamid Gul, who was largely responsible for developing the strategy,
once said to me: "If the jihadis go out and contain India, tying down one rnillion men of their army on their own soil, for a
legitimate cause, why should we not support them?" Next to Gul in his Islamabad living room lay a piece of the Berlin
Wall presented to him by the city's people for "delivering the first blow" to the Soviet empire through his use of jihadis in
the 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest he is still busy liaising with jihadis in his "retirement".
The Pakistani military top brass were long convinced that they could control the militants they have nurtured. In a taped
conversation between President Pervez Musharraf and Muhammad Aziz Khan, his chief of general staff, that India
released in 1999, Aziz said the army had the jihadis by their "tooti" (balls). Yet the Islamists have increasingly followed
their own agendas, sending suicide bombers out against not just Pakistan's religious minorities and political leaders, but
even the IS! headquarters. Nonetheless, many in the army still believe the jihadis are a more practical defence against
Indian hegemony than nuclear weapons. For them, supporting Islamist groups is not an ideological or religious whim, so
much as a practical and patriotic imperative - a vital survival strategy for a Pakistani state.
The army and ISI continued this duplicitous and risky policy after 11 September 2001 despite Musharrafs public
promises to the contrary. The speed with which the US lost interest in Afghanistan after its invasion and embarked on
plans to invade Iraq convinced the Pakistani army that the Washington had no long-term commitment to Karzai's
regime. This led to the generals keeping the Taliban in reserve, to be used to reinstal a pro-Pakistani regime in Kabul
once the American gaze had turned elsewhere.
So it was that the .ISI gave refuge to the leadership of the Taliban after it fled from Afghanistan in 2001. Mullah
Mohammed Omar was kept in an IS! safehouse in Quetta; his militia was lodged in the sprawling suburb of
Pashtunabad. There, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided over the Taliban military committee and war chest.
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizb-e-lslami, was lured back from exile in Iran and allowed to operate freely
outside Peshawar, while Jalaluddin Haqqani, one of the most violent Taliban commanders, was given sanctuary in North
Waziristan. Other groups were despatched to safehouses in Balochistan.
By 2004, the US had filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters at the Afghan border and recovering them
a few days later; wireless monitoring at the US base at Bagram picked up Taliban commanders arranging with Pakistani
army officers at the border for safe passage as they came in and out of Afghanistan. Western intelligence agencies
concluded that the ISI was running a full training programme for the Afghan Taliban, turning a blind eye as they raised
funds in the Gulf and allowing them to import materiel, mainly via Dubai. By 2005 the Taliban, with covert Pakistani
support, were launching a full-scale assault on Nato troops in Afghanistan and being given covering fire as they returned
to their bases in Pakistan.
At the same time, Taliban attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan intensified, beginning the process of turning the
Afghan conflict, like that in Kashmir, into what it is today: an lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy in Kabul was twice
bombed - in July 2008 and October 2009 - as were two city-centre hotels thought to have been used by the Research
and Analysis Wing (Raw), the Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians and two Indian military officers died in
the blasts.
The degree to which the ISI has been controlling the Afghan Taliban has only just become clear, and not just in the
documents published by WikiLeaks. A report by Matt Waldman of the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard, based
on interviews with ten former senior Taliban commanders, closely documents how the IS! "orchestrates, sustains and
strongly influences" the Taliban and shows how the !SI is even represented on the Taliban's supreme leadership
council, the Quetta Shura.
Meanwhile, in the Punjab, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the man believed to have been
behind the 2008 Bombay attacks, has been allowed to continue operating from Muridke, near Lahore. "The powerful
western world is terrorising Muslims," he told a conference in Islamabad this year. "We are being invaded, manipulated

and looted. We must fight the evil trio of America, Israel and India. Suicide missions are in accordance with Islam. In
fact, a suicide attack is the best form of jihad."
At the same time as Pursuing its policy of selectively using jihadis, Pakistan has appeased the US by giving generous
assistance to the CIA in arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault was also launched against both the
militants who took over the Lal Masjid and the ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban who took over the Swat Valley and
announced their intention of turning the country into an Islamic Emirate. In the course of these operations and others in
the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, more than 1,500 Pakistani soldiers and policemen were killed; another 250,000
people were made homeless in the Pak army assault on Bajaur. The IS1 has even been prepared to arrest any members
of the Afghan Taliban who didn't follow orders. Hence the seizure in Karachi, in February, of the Taliban second-in-
command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, along with aboutia dozen other senior Taliban whom the ISI regarded as
infringing on their hospitality by opening talks with the Karzai administration via the Saudis, without ISI clearance.
Yet, even though the Pakistani army has conducted major offensives in six of the tribal areas, the seventh, North
Waziristan, has been left alone, as it is home to the ISI's favourite proxies: Haqqani and Hekmatyar. Similarly, Pakistan's
foot-dragging response to the 2008 attacks on Bombay, and the lack of response to the attacks on minority faith groups
in Pakistan over the past few months, show that the Janus-faced policy remains in place. This summer, the chief
minister of the Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, was quoted heatedly denying that there were any militant groups working in the
Pakistani Punjab, or that the Punjabi Taliban even existed. There are still, in the eyes of many in the Pakistani
establishment, good Taliban and bad Taliban, useful militants and expendable ones.
In their eyes, the ongoing defeat of Nato in Afghanistan, with US and British troops suffering record casualties last
month, is a vindication of its long-term strategy. Islamabad has succeeded in regaining influence in Afghanistan and
Delhi has been checked. But India will not take this lying down. Already the Indian press has reported attempts to -
resuscitate the Northern Alliance as a contingency against the Taliban's takeover of the south, and here India is working
in conjuction with Russia, Iran and the central Asian "stans". The Indian national security adviser, Shivshankar Menon,
was despatched to Afghanistan in March, and the foreign minister, S M Krishna, has visited Tehran. Post-American
Afghanistan is looking increasingly likely to be divided between the Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara north and the Pashtun
south, either formally, with a partition, or more likely, to slip into inter-ethnic civil war, with India supporting and arming
the north and Pakistan the south.
As diplomacy gathers pace, the Afghan Taliban, who already control over 70 per cent of the country. continue to
increase their power. The most worrying development has been the spread of Taliban units to the previously peaceful
north, where they have taken over pockets of Pathan settlement around Kunduz and Badakhshan. The death of the
British aid worker Karen Woo on 5 August was a direct result.
In Pakistan. too, jihadi activity is growing. Last year there were 87 suicide attacks across the country, killing roughly
3,000 people and the ISI this week stated that, for the first time in the nation's history, it regarded home-grown Islamic
militants to be a bigger threat to the integrity of the nation than India. Yet the army continues to obsess about India. In a
recent speech, Kayani emphasised that although the army knows the dangers of militancy, it was against Indian attacks
that he was principally focused. At a time when Pakistan's economy is in crisis, electricity supply increasingly erratic and
the educational system in complete breakdown, Kayani has secured a huge increase in the country's defence budget.
It is not a pretty picture: growing violence everywhere, increasing Indo-Pak tensions and a defeat for western interests in
the region. Worst of all, because the Pakistani army regards this as a major triumph, it is unlikely to change its policy any
time soon.

The Education of a President
These days, Obama has been seeking guidance in presidential biographies. He is reading, among others, ""The
Clinton Tapes," Taylor Branch's account of his secret interviews with Bill Clinton during the eight years of his
presidency. "I was looking over some chronicles of the Clinton years," Obama told me, "and was reminded that
in '94 — when President Clinton's poll numbers were lower than mine, and obviously the election ended up
being bad for Democrats — unemployment was only 6.6 percent. And I don't think anybody would suggest that
Bill Clinton wasn't a good communicator or was somebody who couldn't connect with the American people or
didn't show empathy."
In the fall of 1994, things were even better than Obama recalls: unemployment was in fact 5.6 percent. If the
feel-your-pain president had trouble when the economy was not nearly as bad as it is now, with 9.6 percent
unemployment, then maybe the issue for Obama is not that he is too cool or detached, as some pundits say.
When the economy is bad, even the most talented of presidents suffer at the polls. "There is an anti-
establishment mood," Rahm Emanuel, the former Clinton aide who served as Obama's first White House chief
of staff, told me before he stepped down this month. "We just happen to be here when the music is stopping."
It would be bad form for the president to anticipate an election result before it happens, but clearly Obama
hopes that just as Clinton recovered from his party's midterm shellacking in 1994 to win re-election two years
later, so can he. There was something odd in hearing Obama invoke Clinton. Two years ago, Obama scorned
the 42nd president, deriding the small-ball politics and triangulation maneuvers and comparing him unfavorably
with Ronald Reagan. Running against Clinton's wife, Obama was the anti-Clinton. Now he hopes, in a way, to
be the second coming of Bill Clinton. Because, in the end, it's better than being Jimmy Carter.
So it is a high priority for Obama to prevent any intraparty fight in 2012, and to date, despite the fire from the
left, no serious challenger appears on the horizon. Putting Hillary Clinton in the cabinet may turn out to be one
of Obama's smartest moves, because it not only eliminated her as a would-be challenger, but it also should
presumably squelch the will-she-or-won't-she speculation that otherwise would have played out for months.
(Instead, the guessing game has her replacing Biden on the ticket, however fanciful that might be.)

The Education of a President
By PETER BAKER
On a busy afternoon in the West Wing late last month, President Barack Obama seemed relaxed and unhurried
as he sat down in a newly reupholstered brown leather chair in the Oval Office. He had just returned from the
East Room, where he signed the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 — using eight pens so he could give away as
many as possible. The act will be his administration's last piece of significant economic legislation before
voters deliver their verdict on his first two years in office. For all intents and purposes, the first chapter of
Obama's presidency has ended. On Election Day, the next chapter will begin.
As he welcomed me, I told him I liked what he had done with the place. Gone was George W. Bush's yellow
sunburst carpet (it says "optimistic person," Bush would tell practically anyone who visited), and in its place
was a much-derided earth-tone rug with inspirational quotations. The curved walls now had striped tan
wallpaper, and the coffee table had been replaced by a walnut-and-mica table that, Obama noted, would resist
stains from water glasses. The bust of Winston Churchill was replaced by one of Martin Luther King Jr. The
couches were new. He told me he was happy with the redecorating of the office. "I know Arianna doesn't like
it," he said lightly. "But I like taupe."
If there was something incongruous about the president of the United States checking out reviews of his decor
by Arianna Huffington, well, let's face it, he has endured worse reviews lately. The president who muscled
through Congress perhaps the most ambitious domestic agenda in a generation finds himself vilified by the
right, castigated by the left and abandoned by the middle. He heads into the final stretch of the midterm
campaign season facing likely repudiation, with voters preparing to give him a Congress that, even if Democrats
maintain control, will almost certainly be less friendly to the president than the one he has spent the last two
years mud wrestling.
While proud of his record, Obama has already begun thinking about what went wrong — and what he needs to
do to change course for the next two years. He has spent what one aide called "a lot of time talking about
Obama 2.0" with his new interim chief of staff, Pete Rouse, and his deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina. During
our hour together, Obama told me he had no regrets about the broad direction of his presidency. But he did
identify what he called "tactical lessons." He let himself look too much like "the same old tax-and-spend liberal
Democrat." He realized too late that "there's no such thing as shovel-ready projects" when it comes to public
works. Perhaps he should not have proposed tax breaks as part of his stimulus and instead "let the Republicans
insist on the tax cuts" so it could be seen as a bipartisan compromise.
Most of all, he has learned that, for all his anti-Washington rhetoric, he has to play by Washington rules if he
wants to win in Washington. It is not enough to be supremely sure that he is right if no one else agrees with
him. "Given how much stuff was coming at us," Obama told me, "we probably spent much more time trying to
get the policy right than trying to get the politics right. There is probably a perverse pride in my administration
— and I take responsibility for this; this was blowing from the top — that we were going to do the right thing,
even if short-term it was unpopular. And I think anybody who's occupied this office has to remember that
success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you can't be neglecting of marketing and
P.R. and public opinion."
That presumes that what he did was the right thing, a matter of considerable debate. The left thinks he did too
little; the right too much. But what is striking about Obama's self-diagnosis is that by his own rendering, the
figure of inspiration from 2008 neglected the inspiration after his election. He didn't stay connected to the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
people who put him in office in the first place. Instead, he simultaneously disappointed those who considered
him the embodiment of a new progressive movement and those who expected him to reach across the aisle to
usher in a postpartisan age. On the campaign trail lately, Obama has been confronted by disillusionment — the
woman who was "exhausted" defending him, the mother whose son campaigned for him but was now looking
for work. Even Shepard Fairey, the artist who made the iconic multihued "Hope" poster, says he's losing hope.
Perhaps that should have come as no surprise. When Obama secured the Democratic nomination in June 2008,
he told an admiring crowd that someday "we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the
moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the
rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and
secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on earth."
I read that line to Obama and asked how his high-flying rhetoric sounded in these days of low-flying
governance. "It sounds ambitious," he agreed. "But you know what? We've made progress on each of those
fronts." He quoted Mario Cuomo's line about campaigning in poetry and governing in prose. "But the prose and
the poetry match up," he said. "It would be very hard for people to look back and say, You know what, Obama
didn't do what he's promised. I think they could say, On a bunch of fronts he still has an incomplete. But I keep
a checklist of what we committed to doing, and we've probably accomplished 70 percent of the things that we
talked about during the campaign. And I hope as long as I'm president, I've got a chance to work on the other
30 percent."
But save the planet? If you promise to save the planet, might people think you would, you know, actually save
the planet? He laughed, before shifting back to hope and inspiration. "I make no apologies for having set high
expectations for myself and for the country, because I think we can meet those expectations," he said. "Now,
the one thing that I will say — which I anticipated and can be tough — is the fact that in a big, messy
democracy like this, everything takes time. And we're not a culture that's built on patience."
These days, Obama has been seeking guidance in presidential biographies. He is reading, among others, "The
Clinton Tapes," Taylor Branch's account of his secret interviews with Bill Clinton during the eight years of his
presidency. "I was looking over some chronicles of the Clinton years," Obama told me, "and was reminded that
in '94 — when President Clinton's poll numbers were lower than mine, and obviously the election ended up
being bad for Democrats — unemployment was only 6.6 percent. And I don't think anybody would suggest that
Bill Clinton wasn't a good communicator or was somebody who couldn't connect with the American people or
didn't show empathy."
In the fall of 1994, things were even better than Obama recalls: unemployment was in fact 5.6 percent. If the
feel-your-pain president had trouble when the economy was not nearly as bad as it is now, with 9.6 percent
unemployment, then maybe the issue for Obama is not that he is too cool or detached, as some pundits say.
When the economy is bad, even the most talented of presidents suffer at the polls. "There is an anti-
establishment mood," Rahm Emanuel, the former Clinton aide who served as Obama's first White House chief
of staff, told me before he stepped down this month. "We just happen to be here when the music is stopping."
It would be bad form for the president to anticipate an election result before it happens, but clearly Obama
hopes that just as Clinton recovered from his party's midterm shellacking in 1994 to win re-election two years
later, so can he. There was something odd in hearing Obama invoke Clinton. Two years ago, Obama scorned
the 42nd president, deriding the small-ball politics and triangulation maneuvers and comparing him unfavorably
with Ronald Reagan. Running against Clinton's wife, Obama was the anti-Clinton. Now he hopes, in a way, to
be the second coming of Bill Clinton. Because, in the end, it's better than being Jimmy Carter.
Last month, I made my way through the West Wing talking not only with Obama but also with nearly two
dozen of his advisers — some of whom spoke with permission, others without — hoping to understand how the
situation looks to them. The view from inside the administration starts with a basic mantra: Obama inherited the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015

worst problems of any president in years. Or in generations. Or in American history. He prevented another
Great Depression while putting in place the foundation for a more stable future. But it required him to do
unpopular things that would inevitably cost him.
"He got here, and the expectations for what he could accomplish were very high and probably unrealistic," Pete
Rouse told me. Indeed, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, the masterminds of the 2008 presidential campaign,
said they cautioned Obama after his victory to brace himself for a precipitous drop in his popularity given the
severity of his challenges. "I told him at some point that at the end of '10, his approval rating could be low- to
mid-30s," Plouffe told me.
Yet even if the White House saw it coming, this is an administration that feels shellshocked. Many officials
worry, they say, that the best days of the Obama presidency are behind them. They talk about whether it is time
to move on. While not in the 30s, Obama's approval rating in surveys conducted by The New York Times and
CBS News had fallen to 45 percent last month from 62 percent when he took office —just a point above where
Clinton was before losing Congress in 1994 and three points above where Reagan was before the Republicans
lost a couple dozen House seats in 1982. Joel Benenson, Obama's pollster, pointed out that even at 45 percent,
the president's popularity eclipses that of Congress, the news media, the banks and other forces in American
life. "We are in a time when the American public is highly suspect of any institution," he said, "and President
Obama still stands above that." Obama's team takes pride that he has fulfilled three of the five major promises
he laid out as pillars of his "new foundation" in an April 2009 speech at Georgetown University — health care,
education reform and financial reregulation. And they point to decisions to end the combat mission in Iraq while
escalating the war in Afghanistan. "History will judge Obama that the first two years were very productive,"
Rouse says.
But it is possible to win the inside game and lose the outside game. In their darkest moments, White House
aides wonder aloud whether it is even possible for a modern president to succeed, no matter how many bills he
signs. Everything seems to conspire against the idea: an implacable opposition with little if any real interest in
collaboration, a news media saturated with triviality and conflict, a culture that demands solutions yesterday, a
societal cynicism that holds leadership in low regard. Some White House aides who were ready to carve a new
spot on Mount Rushmore for their boss two years ago privately concede now that he cannot be another
Abraham Lincoln after all. In this environment, they have increasingly concluded, it may be that every modern
president is going to be, at best, average.
"We're all a lot more cynical now," one aide told me. The easy answer is to blame the Republicans, and White
House aides do that with exuberance. But they are also looking at their own misjudgments, the hubris that led
them to think they really could defy the laws of politics. "It's not that we believed our own press or press
releases, but there was definitely a sense at the beginning that we could really change Washington," another
White House official told me. "'Arrogance' isn't the right word, but we were overconfident."
The biggest miscalculation in the minds of most Obama advisers was the assumption that he could bridge a
polarized capital and forge genuinely bipartisan coalitions. While Republican leaders resolved to stand against
Obama, his early efforts to woo the opposition also struck many as halfhearted. "If anybody thought the
Republicans were just going to roll over, we were just terribly mistaken," former Senator Tom Daschle, a
mentor and an outside adviser to Obama, told me. "I'm not sure anybody really thought that, but I think we kind
of hoped the Republicans would go away. And obviously they didn't do that."
Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the upper chamber and Obama's ally from Illinois, said the
Republicans were to blame for the absence of bipartisanship. "I think his fate was sealed," Durbin said. "Once
the Republicans decided they would close ranks to defeat him, that just made it extremely difficult and dragged
it out for a longer period of time. The American people have a limited attention span. Once you convince them
there's a problem, they want a solution."

Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, though, is among the Democrats who grade Obama harshly for not being
more nimble in the face of opposition. "B-plus, A-minus on substantive accomplishments," he told me, "and a
D-plus or C-minus on communication." The health care legislation is "an incredible achievement" and the
stimulus program was "absolutely, unqualifiedly, enormously successful," in Rendell's judgment, yet Obama
allowed them to be tarnished by critics. "They lost the communications battle on both major initiatives, and they
lost it early," said Rendell, an ardent Hillary Clinton backer who later became an Obama supporter. "We didn't
use the president in either stimulus or health care until we had lost the spin battle."
That's a refrain heard inside the White House as well: it's a communication problem. The first refuge of any
politician in trouble is that it's a communication problem, not a policy problem. If only I explained what I was
doing better, the people would be more supportive. Which roughly translates to If only you people paid
attention, you wouldn't be kicking me upside the head. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, laughed
at the ever-ready assumption that all problems stem from poor communication. "I haven't been at a policy-
problem meeting in 20 months," he noted.
The policy criticism of Obama can be confusing and deeply contradictory — he is a liberal zealot, in the view
of the right; a weak accommodationist, in the view of the left. He is an anticapitalist socialist who is too cozy
with Wall Street, a weak-on-defense apologist for America who adopted Bush's unrelenting antiterror tactics at
the expense of civil liberties.
"When he talked about being a transformational president, it was about restoring the faith of the American
people in our governing institutions," says Ken Duberstein, the former Reagan White House chief of staff who
voted for Obama in 2008. "What we now know is that that did not work. If anything, people are even more
dubious about all of our institutions, especially government. So to that extent, the transformational side has not
worked. And frankly I would settle these days — forget about transformational, how about a transactional
president, somebody people could do business with? It seems there's an ideological rigidity that the American
people did not sense."
The other side would like more ideological rigidity. Norman Solomon, a leading progressive activist and the
president of the Institute for Public Accuracy, said Obama has "totally blown this great opportunity" to reinvent
America by being more aggressive on issues like a public health care option. Other liberals feel the same way
about gays in the military or the prison at Guantanamo Bay. "It's been so reflexive since he was elected, to just
give ground and give ground," Solomon told me. "If we don't call him a wimp, which may be the wrong word,
he just seems to be backpedaling." Solomon added: "It makes people feel angry and perhaps used. People just
feel like, Gee, we really believed in this guy, and his rhetoric is so different than the way he's behaved in
office."
Pummeled from both sides, Obama clearly seems frustrated and, at times, defensive. At a Labor Day event in
Milwaukee, he complained that the special interests treat him badly. "They're not always happy with me," he
told supporters. "They talk about me like a dog — that's not in my prepared remarks, but it's true."
The friendly fire may bother him even more. "Democrats just congenitally tend to see the glass as half empty,"
Obama said at a fund-raiser in Greenwich, Conn., last month. "If we get an historic health care bill passed —
oh, well, the public option wasn't there. If you get the financial reform bill passed — then, well, I don't know
about this particular derivatives rule, I'm not sure that I'm satisfied with that. And, gosh, we haven't yet brought
about world peace. I thought that was going to happen quicker."
Then again, it is Obama himself, and not just his supporters, who casts his presidency in grandiose terms. As he
pleaded with Democrats for patience at another fund-raiser in Washington two weeks later: "It took time to free
the slaves. It took time for women to get the vote. It took time for workers to get the right to organize."

One morning around the 100-day mark in Obama's administration, the president and his top aides gathered for
their morning meeting in the Oval Office. As they waited for David Axelrod, who was running late, someone
noted the coming milestone and asked Obama what surprised him most since taking office. "The number of
people who don't pay their taxes," he answered sardonically.
From the start, Obama has been surprised by all sorts of challenges that have made it hard for him to govern —
not just the big problems that he knew about, like the economy and the wars, but also the myriad little ones that
hindered his progress, like one nominee after another brought down by unpaid taxes. Obama trusted his
judgment and seemed to have assumed that impressive people in his own party must have a certain basic sense
of integrity — and that impressive people in the other party must want to work with him.
Four of the five presidents previous to Obama were governors who came to Washington vowing to fix it, only
to realize that Washington defies the easy, and often hollow, rhetoric of change. While Obama was a senator
when he set off on the campaign trail, he made the same pledges and has encountered the same reality. "The
story of the first two years is the inherent conflict between a guy who ran from outside to change Washington,
gets here and the situation was even worse than we thought it was," a senior aide told me. "Here's a guy who
ran as an outsider to change Washington who all of a sudden realized that just to deal with these issues, we were
going to have to work with Washington to fix that."
Obama does little to disguise his disdain for Washington and the conventions of modern politics. When he
emerges from the Oval Office during the day, aides say, he sometimes pauses before the split-screen television
in the outer reception area, soaks in the cable chatter, then shakes his head and walks away. "He's still never
gotten comfortable here," a top White House official told me. He has little patience for what Valerie Jarrett, a
senior adviser, calls "the inevitable theatrics of Washington."
But in politics, theater matters, whether it should or not, a lesson Obama keeps relearning, however grudgingly.
His decision to redecorate the Oval Office was criticized as an unnecessary luxury in a time of austerity, no
matter that it was paid for by private funds. On the campaign trail, he thought it was silly to wear a flag pin, as
if that were a measure of his patriotism, until his refusal to wear a flag pin generated distracting criticism and
one day he showed up wearing one. Likewise, he thought it was enough to pray in private while living in the
White House, and then a poll showed that most Americans weren't sure he's Christian; sure enough, a few
weeks later, he attended services at St. John's Church across from Lafayette Square, photographers in tow.
Obama came to office with enormous faith in his own powers of persuasion. He seemed to believe he could
overcome divisions if he just sat down with the world's most recalcitrant figures — whether they be the mullahs
in Tehran or the Republicans on Capitol Hill. As it turned out, the candidate who said he would be willing to
meet in his first year with some of America's enemies "without precondition" has met with none of them. And
the president who in his State of the Union address this year promised to meet monthly with leaders of both
parties in Congress ended up doing so just half as often.
He has yet to fully decide whether he is of Washington or apart from it. During the health care debate, Obama
had Emanuel cut deals with the pharmaceutical industry, while Axelrod presented the president as above the old
business as usual. "Perhaps we were naïve," Axelrod told me. "First, he's always had good relations across
party lines. And secondly, I think he believed that in the midst of a crisis you could find partners on the other
side of the aisle to help deal with it. I don't think anyone here expected the degree of partisanship that we
confronted." Emanuel said Republicans adopted a strategy of poisoning the public well. "Part of what they were
doing was not just making us grind it out," he told me. "They were souring the country on the mood of the
country."
Still, Obama plays the partisan game as well. After months of quiet negotiations, some administration officials
thought they were close to a package of new financial regulations with Republican support when, to their
chagrin, the White House decided to use the issue to wage a high-profile and politically useful battle with Wall

Street special interests. At that point, the chances for a deal across party lines collapsed, administration officials
said, and Obama was left to rely almost entirely on Democratic votes.
Obama advisers who left the White House recently have been struck how different, and worse, things look from
the outside. As he made a round of corporate job interviews after stepping down as White House budget
director, Peter Orszag was stunned to discover how deep the gulf between the president and business had
become. "I'd thought it was an 8, but it's more like a 10," he told me. "And rather than wasting time debating
whether it's legitimate," he added, referring to his former colleagues, "the key is to recognize that it's affecting
what they do."
Insulation is a curse of every president, but more than any president since Jimmy Carter, Obama comes across
as an introvert, someone who finds extended contact with groups of people outside his immediate circle to be
draining. He can rouse a stadium of 80,000 people, but that audience is an impersonal monolith; smaller group
settings can be harder for him. Aides have learned that it can be good if he has a few moments after a big East
Room event so he can gather his energy again. Unlike Clinton, who never met a rope line he did not want to
work, Obama does not relish glad-handing. That's what he has Vice President Joe Biden for. When Obama
addressed the Business Roundtable this year, he left after his speech without much meet-and-greet, leaving his
aides frustrated that he had done himself more harm than good. He is not much for chitchat. When he and I sat
down, he started our session matter-of-factly: "All right," he said, "fire away."
By all accounts, Obama copes with his political troubles with equanimity. "Zen" is the word commonly used in
the West Wing. That's not to say he never loses his temper. He has been known to snap at aides when he feels
overscheduled. He cuts off advisers who spout information straight from briefing papers with a testy "I've
already read that." He does not like it when aides veer out of their assigned lanes, yet they have learned to show
up at meetings with an opinion, because he zeroes in on those who stay silent. He was subdued during the Gulf
of Mexico oil spill, when he found himself largely powerless. Other presidents took refuge at Camp David, but
Michelle Obama has told dinner guests that her husband does not care for it all that much, because he is an
urban guy. He blows off steam on the White House basketball court. "Come on, man, you've got to make that
shot," he chides aides who play with him.
The most obvious sign of strain is in his hair. "He'll probably be unhappy with me for saying, but I've noticed
he's gotten a little grayer," Defense Secretary Robert Gates told me over the summer. "These kinds of decisions
do that to people." But the stress of the job remains mostly unspoken. "We usually will talk about writing the
condolence letters," Gates added. "But other than that, we don't dwell on it." If anything, Obama more often
than not bucks up young members of his staff, reminding them that politics, like life, is full of cycles and they
will someday be able to tell their children that they were part of something big.
While Clinton made late-night phone calls around Washington to vent or seek advice, Obama rarely reaches
outside the tight group of advisers like Emanuel, Axelrod, Rouse, Messina, Plouffe, Gibbs and Jarrett, as well as
a handful of personal friends. "He's opaque even to us," an aide told me. "Except maybe for a few people in the
inner circle, he's a closed book." In part because of security, just 15 people have his BlackBerry e-mail address.
On long Air Force One flights, he retreats to the conference room and plays spades for hours, maintaining a
trash-talking contest all the while, with the same three aides: Reggie Love, his personal assistant; Marvin
Nicholson, his trip director; and Pete Souza, his White House photographer. (When I asked if he had an iPad,
Obama said, "I have an iReggie, who has my books, my newspapers, my music all in one place.")
Jarrett attributes Obama's equilibrium to his upbringing. "He's really different," she told me. "It's rooted in his
sense of self and how he grew up with a single mom, living at times on food stamps, working as a community
organizer." As Gibbs put it: "He has a remarkable way of focusing on the big picture and the longer term. It's
not to say that he's immune from criticism. But he can categorize in his head the difference between what's a
setback, what's a bump along the way and what's just noise."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
There is certainly no shortage of noise. But as Obama gets back on the campaign trail, aides have noticed his
old spirit again. He particularly enjoys the so-called backyard sessions on the lawns of supporters. "That's the
happiest I've seen him in a long time," an aide said. After one, Obama told the aide, "This reminds me of Iowa
on the bus."
Nostalgia for the good old days of the campaign afflicts any White House in trouble. After all, those were the
romantic moments when all was possible, when tens of thousands of people would gather in Grant Park to tear
up over the promise of what will be. But in sober moments, Obama understands how selective the memories
really are. "The mythology has emerged somehow that we ran this flawless campaign, I never made a mistake,
that we were master communicators, everything worked in lock step," he told me. "And somehow now, as
president, things are messy and they don't always work as planned and people are mad at us. That's not how I
look at stuff, because I remember what the campaign was like. And it was just as messy and just as difficult.
And there were all sorts of moments when our supporters lost hope, and it looked like we weren't going to win.
And we're going through that same period here."
In covering the last three presidents, I have watched as each has been tested, albeit in very different
circumstances — Clinton's impeachment over false testimony under oath about an affair with a White House
intern, Bush's drive to begin a war that would drag on for years at enormous cost and Obama's struggle to turn
around the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. They are starkly variable crises, but some
dynamics are familiar: presidents who live and die by polls insist they are not important when they fall; they
argue that they are focused on principle, not politics, when it's almost always a mixture of both; they
acknowledge difficulties but say they will pass; they portray themselves as courageous when flying against
public opinion; they complain that the news media distort the situation and fuel division; they blame their
opponents for practicing the politics of destruction and obstruction.
Talking with Obama and his aides, it's eerie to hear echoes of Clinton and Bush. Obama says the easy issues
never make it to him, only the hard ones; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says our war with terrorists
will never end in a surrender ceremony; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says he does not want to kick
problems down the road; Bush often said the same thing. In the days leading up to the 1994 midterm elections,
Clinton mocked Republicans for promising to balance the budget while cutting taxes, saying, "They're not
serious." In our conversation, Obama used some variation of the phrase "they're not serious" four times in
referring to Republican budget plans.
That is not to say the three men are alike; indeed, they are vastly different. But putting ideology aside, Obama at
times seems to be a cross between his two predecessors. Like Clinton, he digs into the intellectual
underpinnings of a policy decision, studying briefing books and seeking a range of opinions. Some aides
express frustration that he can leave decisions unresolved for too long. But like Bush, once he has made a
decision, Obama rarely revisits it. And like Bush, he runs a pretty disciplined operation; he started our interview
a half-hour ahead of schedule, just as Bush sometimes did. Clinton, on the other hand, still runs on Clinton
Standard Time. Just a few weeks ago, he was more than six hours late for a scheduled interview with another
journalist. One constant among all three: It took Clinton and Bush some time to really grow into the presidency,
until they wore it comfortably.
As Obama looks to the experiences of Clinton and Reagan, who both rebounded from midterm debacles to win
re-election, the lessons differ. In Reagan's case, the House was already in Democratic hands, so during his first
two years, he forged coalitions of Republicans and conservative Democrats. After the opposition was
strengthened in the 1982 elections, that was no longer viable, and Reagan began working more with Democratic
leaders. Clinton likewise changed course after the 1994 elections, emphasizing more incremental, piece-by-
piece change rather than sweeping proposals and pursuing goals like welfare reform and balanced budgets when
he could agree with Newt Gingrich's new majority.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
Clinton, though, was more instinctively centrist than Obama is, and his revival owed much to other factors,
particularly his leadership after the Oklahoma City bombing and his budget standoff with Gingrich during the
partial government shutdown. Some argue Obama might be better off with at least one Republican chamber so
he too has a foil as Clinton did. But it is unclear if Obama is as agile a politician as Reagan or Clinton. "He's no
Bill Clinton when it comes to having the ability to move and to wiggle," says Joe Gaylord, a top Gingrich
adviser. "I find rigidity in Obama that comes from his life in liberalism." Ken Duberstein likewise doubts
Obama's capacity for adjustment. "They're much better at the art of campaigning than the art of governing," he
said.
Perhaps the more important historical pattern to consider is this one: The last four presidents who failed to win a
second term were all challenged in their own party. Lyndon Johnson was driven out of the race in 1968 after
nearly losing the New Hampshire primary to Eugene McCarthy. Gerald Ford fended off Reagan in 1976 but
went on to lose the general election to Carter, who likewise had to beat a primary challenger four years later,
Ted Kennedy, before falling to Reagan. And George H. W. Bush had to overcome Patrick Buchanan before
losing to Clinton in 1992.
So it is a high priority for Obama to prevent any intraparty fight in 2012, and to date, despite the fire from the
left, no serious challenger appears on the horizon. Putting Hillary Clinton in the cabinet may turn out to be one
of Obama's smartest moves, because it not only eliminated her as a would-be challenger, but it also should
presumably squelch the will-she-or-won't-she speculation that otherwise would have played out for months.
(Instead, the guessing game has her replacing Biden on the ticket, however fanciful that might be.)
As the first African-American president, Obama is more aware than most of the limits of looking back. But he
also has read enough presidential biographies to know he is not the first to encounter rocky times. "History
never precisely repeats itself," Obama told me. "But there is a pattern in American presidencies — at least
modern presidencies. You come in with excitement and fanfare. The other party initially, having been beaten,
says it wants to cooperate with you. You start implementing your program as you promised during the
campaign. The other party pushes back very hard. It causes a lot of consternation and drama in Washington.
People who are already cynical and skeptical about Washington generally look at it and say, This is the same
old mess we've seen before. The president's poll numbers drop. And you have to then sort of wrestle back the
confidence of the people as the programs that you've put in place start bearing fruit."
To better understand history, and his role in it, Obama invited a group of presidential scholars to dinner in
May in the living quarters of the White House. Obama was curious about, among other things, the Tea Party
movement. Were there precedents for this sort of backlash against the establishment? What sparked them and
how did they shape American politics? The historians recalled the Know-Nothings in the 1850s, the Populists in
the 1890s and Father Charles Coughlin in the 1930s. "He listened," the historian H. W. Brands told me. "What
he concluded, I don't know."
Obama's conclusions are still being formed. He has learned that "Washington is even more broken than we
thought," as one aide put it. He has trusted his own judgment as he disregarded advisers who told him to scale
back health care at various stages. And he has found that his vaunted speaking skills are not enough to change
the dynamics of governance. "One of the lessons he has to learn is What is the best form of communication for
him with the American people," the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin told me. "He's so good in front of an
audience, and I get the sense that he needs the energy off the audience. And so speaking to television cameras
doesn't really do that."
As we talked in the Oval Office, Obama acknowledged that the succession of so many costly initiatives,
necessary as they may have been, wore on the public. "That accumulation of numbers on the TV screen night in
and night out in those first six months I think deeply and legitimately troubled people," he told me. "They
started feeling like: Gosh, here we are tightening our belts, we're cutting out restaurants, we're cutting out our

gym membership, in some cases we're not buying new clothes for the kids. And here we've got these folks in
Washington who just seem to be printing money and spending it like nobody's business.
"And it reinforced the narrative that the Republicans wanted to promote anyway, which was Obama is not a
different kind of Democrat — he's the same old tax-and-spend liberal Democrat."
Emanuel told me that the cascading crises in Obama's early days exacted a lasting toll. "The seeds of his
political difficulty today were planted in taking those steps," he said. White House officials largely agree they
should not have let the health care process drag out while waiting for Republican support that would never
come. "It's not what people felt they sent Barack Obama to Washington to do, to be legislator in chief," a top
adviser told me. "It lent itself to the perception that he wasn't doing anything on the economy." Plouffe agreed
that guilt by association with Democratic lawmakers did not help. "When you swim in those waters, you're
going to be affected by that," he said. "I do think he's paid a political price, somewhat, for having to be tied to
Congress."
Still, for all the second-guessing, what you do not hear in the White House is much questioning of the basic
elements of the program — Obama aides, liberal and moderate alike, reject complaints from the right that the
stimulus did not help the economy or that health care expands government too much, as well as complaints
from the left that he should have pushed for a bigger stimulus package or held out for a public health care
option. "We asked for more stimulus than we ended up with," Larry Summers, the outgoing national economics
adviser, told me. "But we fought as hard as we could, and I believe we got as much as Congress was ever going
to give us at that time."
And they argue that any mistakes affected things only at the margins. "There's all this talk in this town — if we
had done energy before health care, if we had focused more on small business, if we had done an Oval on the
economy instead of Iraq, we would be doing better," Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director, says. "I don't
believe that. We could always do things differently, and there are plenty of things I wish I had back. But I don't
know they'd change the overall trend."
Melody Barnes, the president's domestic-policy adviser, says the biggest problem was that after eight years of
Bush, Obama's supporters were very eager to change everything right away. "The pent-up demand across every
issue area — around science, around education, around health care, immigration, you name it — there was a lot
of desire to finally get these things done," she told me. "Every segment of the population had something that
was very important to them that they really wanted to put over the finish line."
Obama is preaching patience in an impatient age. One prominent Democratic lawmaker told me Obama's
problem is that he is not insecure — he always believes he is the smartest person in any room and never feels
the sense of panic that makes a good politician run scared all the time, frenetically wooing lawmakers, power
brokers, adversaries and voters as if the next election were a week away.
Instead, what you hear Obama aides talking about is that the system is "not on the level." That's a phrase
commonly used around the West Wing — "it's not on the level." By that, they mean the Republicans, the news
media, the lobbyists, the whole Washington culture is not serious about solving problems. The challenge, as
they see it, is how to rise above a town that can obsess for a week on whether an obscure Agriculture
Department official in Georgia should have been fired. At the same time, as Emanuel told me, "We have to play
the game."
As Brands, the historian, put it, "It'll be really interesting to see if a president who is thinking long term can
have an impact on a political system that is almost irredeemably short term in its perspective."
"I'd rather be a really good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president." So Obama told Diane
Sawyer of ABC News last January at another low point, just after the Republican Scott Brown captured the

Massachusetts Senate seat held for decades by Ted Kennedy, costing Democrats their filibuster-proof control of
the upper chamber and jeopardizing the president's health care plan.
It's a good line, but it's one of those things easier said in the first or second year of a presidency. By the third, it
starts to become an actual choice. Forks in the road require a president to decide if he will advance ideas that
will genuinely change the country even if deeply unpopular or if he will opt instead for a safer route that does
not put re-election at risk. Obama aides like to argue that he has already demonstrated willingness to put aside
politics by bailing out the banks and automakers, decisions that he saw as critical to preventing greater
economic catastrophe (and that ultimately cost taxpayers far less than initially feared).
But would he jeopardize re-election absent an immediate crisis? The choice may confront him soon after the
midterms when his bipartisan fiscal commission reports back by Dec. 1 with plans to tame the national deficit
with a politically volatile menu of unpalatable options, like scaling back Medicare and Social Security while
raising taxes. Obama also anticipates putting immigration reform, another divisive issue fraught with political
danger, back on the table. "If the question is, Over the next two years do I take a pass on tough stuff," he told
me, "the answer is no."
Obama's aides say they will most likely set up their re-election campaign around next March, roughly the same
as when Bush and Clinton incorporated their incumbent campaign operations. They are more optimistic about
2012 than they are about 2010, believing the Tea Party will re-elect Barack Obama by pulling the Republican
nominee to the right. They doubt Sarah Palmn will run and figure Mitt Romney cannot get the Republican
nomination because he enacted his own health care program in Massachusetts. If they had to guess today, some
in the White House say that Obama will find himself running against Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas
governor.
With that campaign on the horizon, Obama asked Pete Rouse and Jim Messina to begin thinking about the next
phase of his presidency, not just personnel but also priorities and message. Never mind that Rouse was among
those who wanted to leave — for years, he has been saying he wanted out of politics but never says no to
Obama. Indeed, when Rouse told colleagues he wanted to leave the White House by the end of this year,
Messina bet him $400 that he would not. "We'll see what happens," Rouse told me when I asked about the bet
last month. Then Obama made Rouse interim chief of staff. Rouse initially resisted moving into Rahm
Emanuel's corner suite until colleagues threatened to move his files for him. Messina jokes that Rouse will turn
off the Oval Office lights after eight years and before assuming his new job, running Obama's presidential
library.
Rouse is managing a slow-motion White House shuffle. By year's end, there will be a new chief of staff, a new
national-economics adviser, a new budget director, a new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a
new national-security adviser, among others. Axelrod and Messina expect to leave by spring to set up Obama's
re-election effort, and Plouffe will almost certainly come into the White House in a senior role.
"There are a lot of lessons learned in the last two years in terms of how we might improve internal
communication, encourage greater accountability without discouraging individual initiative," said one aide
familiar with the discussions led by Rouse and Messina. Obama has been aggravated by friction among his
advisers. "He's a little frustrated with the internal dysfunction," the aide said. "He doesn't like confrontation."
But his initial choices to fill open slots have been drawn largely from his administration, suggesting more
continuity than change.
Rouse and Messina see areas for possible bipartisan agreement, like reauthorizing the nation's education laws to
include reform measures favored by centrists and conservatives, passing long-pending trade pacts and possibly
even producing scaled-back energy legislation. "You'll hear more about exports and less about public
spending," a senior White House official said. "You'll hear more about initiative and private sector and less

about the Department of Energy. You'll hear more about government as a financier and less about government
as a hirer."
Obama expressed optimism to me that he could make common cause with Republicans after the midterm
elections. "It may be that regardless of what happens after this election, they feel more responsible," he said,
"either because they didn't do as well as they anticipated, and so the strategy of just saying no to everything and
sitting on the sidelines and throwing bombs didn't work for them, or they did reasonably well, in which case the
American people are going to be looking to them to offer serious proposals and work with me in a serious way."
I asked if there were any Republicans he trusted enough to work with on economic issues. The first name he
came up with was Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who initially agreed to serve as Obama's commerce
secretary before changing his mind. But Gregg is retiring. The only other Republican named by Obama was
Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman who has put together a detailed if politically problematic blueprint for
reducing federal spending. The two men are ideologically poles apart, but perhaps Obama sees a bit of himself
in a young, substantive policy thinker.
Even if such an alliance emerges, though, the next two years will be mostly about cementing what Obama did in
his first two years — and defending it against challenges in Congress and the courts. "Even if! had the exact
same Congress, even if we don't lose a seat in the Senate and we don't lose a seat in the House, I think the
rhythms of the next two years would inevitably be different from the rhythms of the first two years," Obama
told me. "There's going to be a lot of work in this administration just doing things right and making sure that
new laws are stood up in the ways they're intended."
As a senior adviser put it, "There's going to be very little incentive for big things over the next two years unless
there's some sort of crisis." Yet Obama and his aides still scorn Bill Clinton's small-bore approach. "It's fair to
assume you're not going to see school uniforms play a big role in the next two years," Plouffe told me. "His
view is you can't spend two years playing four-corners." Before he left, Emanuel told me: "I'm not of the view
that you do nothing. I think you've got to have an agenda."
But what sort of agenda? Not as sweeping and not as provocative, say some advisers. "It will have to be limited
and focused on the things that are achievable and high priorities for the American people," Dick Durbin told
me. Tom Daschle said Obama would have to reach out to adversaries. "The lessons of the last two years are
going to be critical," he told me. "The key word is 'inclusion.' He's got to find ways to be inclusive."
Rendell thinks otherwise. "Don't care so much about bipartisanship if the Republicans continue to refuse to
cooperate," he advised. "Do what you have to do. Fight back." At the same time, he said, stop moaning about
what he inherited: "After the election, I'd say no more pointing back, no more blaming the Bush administration.
It's O.K. to do that during the campaign and then stop. But to do it as much as we do it, it sounds like a broken
record. And after two years, you own it."
Obama will own it for another two years, or six if he can find his way forward. As an author, Obama
appreciates the rhythms of a tumultuous story. But who is the protagonist, really? At bottom, this president is
still a mystery to many Americans. During the campaign, he sold himself— or the idea of himself— more than
any particular policy, and voters filled in the lines as they chose. He was, as he said at the time, the ultimate
Rorschach test.
Now the lines are being filled in further. With each choice Obama makes, he further defines himself for better
or worse in Americans' minds. He says he knows where he is going and is gathering momentum despite the
hurdles ahead. As he told a group of visitors during the week last spring that Congress passed health care and
his administration reached agreement on an arms-control treaty with Russia, "I start slow, but I finish strong."
He will have to, if the history he is writing is to turn out the way he prefers.

It's a very New York crowd and very Diane style event (i.e. unconventional) Last year, it was held in one of the big
delegates' lounges at the UN and she redid all the chairs, etc in her patterns. The awards are all serious and DVF is the
moderator. Each awardee receives 50K for her ongoing work. The event bears no resemblance to a typical foreign policy
event, but if you were in NY, you could arrive for the awards and leave. I have no doubt you would be very warmly
embraced and DVF and Barry are so fond of you. I would only do it if could be easily done.

We are planning our Women of the World Conference again for next March. On Saturday night, March 12th, I
will be having the 2nd DVF Award at a dinner at the UN. 2 of the recipients will be women from Vital Voices, one will be
voted by people on line and the fourth one is the special one give to formidable example of courage and leadership. Last
year it was given to Ingrid Betancourt by Meryll Streep.
More than anything, I would love if you would be willing to accept that award. YOU are such an example of
strength. leadership and spirit to all of us women.
Am I dreaming or would you be willing to accept it ?

I have not been able to get a psychology dinner set up, but I have found the article that you read on
the difference an apology can make in the Middle East (coming in next email) and commissioned a
useful paper from Louise Diamond, an expert on psychology and negotiations who has done a lot
of work between the Israels and the Palestinians herself (attached). It's about 5 pages; I really think
it is worth a read. Finally, on changing the frame to look forward, I strongly recommend that you
spend 8 minutes to look at a video produced by a Rand study called The Arc, which proposes a
high-speed road/rail project connecting the key cities in the West Bank and Gaza. It is a powerful,
powerful vision of what could be, one that will play right into Bibi's emphasis on economic growth.
For my money, it would be worth a private 8 minutes screening. I will send the link in the next

As the attached proposal explains, the new strategy is substantially different from previous historical constructs

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is greeted upon arrival by Malaysian Foreign Minister Dato' Sri Anifah bin Haji
Ahmad. U.S. Government photo in the public domain.
By Derek Pham, Research Intern, CSIS Southeast Asia Program
In 1998, President Bill Clinton declined to attend the APEC meeting hosted by Malaysia and had Vice President
Al Gore take his place. It was hoped the meeting would provide a welcome opportunity for the administration to
elevate ties with Malaysia, but the outcome resulted in embarrassment. Vice President Gore famously gutted the
relationship in a dinner speech so awkward that he walked straight out of the room immediately after delivering it.
Twelve years later, America's leading diplomat returned to Malaysia determined to not make the same mistake.
The sense of magic that accompanied Hillary Clinton's trip to Malaysia combined with Prime Minister Najib's
national vision provided for ideal diplomatic synergy. This helped Clinton achieve a feat which had eluded her
husband: transforming US Malaysia ties from a relationship to a partnership. Read more of this post

I noticed on your schedule that you are meeting with a number of tech CEO's this evening. Google should be an obvious
co-sponsor of the USA Pavilion and they have consistently pushed us off. Although they bring up IP issues as a reason
not to participate, the Chinese frequently note that they do a lot of business in China. We are now at $54 million. If the
opportunity arises, it would be helpful to note the importance of a USA standing in Shanghai.

Google has been wierd about this whole deal but this whole Espo experience has been fascinating. Some companies will
say absolutely no for months (Qualcomm, Bloomberg, .1&.1) and then pop out of nowhere and say yes. Others like All are
in for and then decide not to give us a penny. Therefore we have to keep bugging these guys.
We WILL raise the money. We are at $54M+ (this wk Hawaii came in for $500k and Bloomberg LLC and need $7M
more. Ideally we would like to raise $10 to 11M to cover any overruns (it's getting more expensive because the US was
so late we are paying more now to build it quicker).
Where it will come from?
A- Right now we have three big companies talking to us in the range of each - Monsanto, Disney, and Oracle.
Haier may go from If two or three come thru big we are done.
B- We also have a number of other companies like Invitrogen, Hormel, Mattel and Major League Baseball in the
range.
C- Interestingly the cities and states are going to their private funders and trying to raise money on their own to
promote their jurisdictions - Chicago, Houston, Georgia, Montana, TN. (In the past, over 20 states participated with
public funds but current budgets are tough). Maybe a chat w Mayor Bloomberg would be worthwhile. For example, I
spoke to the University of WA and they will probably get benefactors to cosponsor at $250k making them the only
university represented.
D- We have approached groups like Pharma and the fashion industry thru Diane von Furstenburg to get them to bundle
smaller companies and both have agreed to do it. I met w DVL and she wants you to know that she is very excited about
helping (they are in the range).
E-We have talked to the elusive Chamber of Commerce again about getting SME's to raise $2-3M in smaller increments.
They are contemplating it.
Finally the two obvious industries that are not involved are the banks (and we know why) and the insurance companies
who are starting to look into the market over there.
Anyway, I did not mean to go on and on but that's where we stand and these are the potential areas to tap. We'll get
there.

Its not like a traditional trade show/expo with specific booths. It is more subtle and the pavilion folks would negotiate
creatively on what they want..
Depdg on amount, they get on the big wall of contributors, we show multiple scenes of NYC in the shows and displays,
they can use the wonderful VIP lounge/auditorium to have NYC day or week at the Expo - the rockettes, Broadway goes
to China, commercial diplomacy, mtgs betwn NYC and Chinese officials, .getting SME's access to China etc. We could
really be creative.
LA, San Fran, San Antonio already in, chicago on way...
As you know the general theme is ""Better Cities, Better Lives". How can NYC not be repped? They cam brag about their
innovations.

Also, I don't see a mtg w POTUS on the 15th--can we get that scheduled?
T want to have my own pre-brief before the Kissinger event.
And. I notice that the HBO event conflicts w a PC mtg at NH. Now w/Doniion in charge can
we get a set time for all the regular mtgs so we don't schedule conflicting events?
When is Adm Mullen having his small Pakistan dinner? if it's the 21st, can I get back in
time from Paris?
If La Raze can pay for a reception for Raul, why is his swearing in ceremony in the
Treaty Room instead of the Franklin? Can't we find a time for them? Also, I won't be able
to go to his reception at a hotel since I have to go to the screening for the Nat Geo
special so that day doesn't work so well. What about on the 26th after T get back from NY
since gill will be in Haiti and could come back to DC?

Good morning Roberta! Congratulations on a successful visit by the Secretary of State. We are looking forward to this
afternoon's teleconference. After opening remarks, Minister Cannon will ask ?rime Minister Bellerive to speak and the
UN (we may only have DPKO LeRoy on line due to visit of Sec Gen to Haiti). He will then ask FM Amorim and Sec State
Clinton to provide their views on the situation and then open the floor to Kouchner and others. Response has been good
and most will be represented at FM level (Mexico/Espinosa may still be in flight from Japan, and Argentina and Costa
Rica will be Vice-Ministers).
There is as well agreement in principle to begin laying the groundwork for a broader Donors Conference on
Reconstruction and our offer to host a preparatory meeting on January 25th has been well received. However, early
indications are that the EU has a conflict as they have their General Relations and Foreign Relations meetings scheduled
for that day. As the EU would be essential for such a meeting we are scrambling to look for alternative dates. Given the
momentum we would rather go earlier than later. Minister Cannon would be available to host this on the weekend of
the 23-24th of January (dinner on the 23rd, meeting on the morning of the 24th). However, I believe that Ambassador
Jacobsen had indicated that Mrs. Clinton has another engagement on the 23rd. Could you please let me know, before
this afternoon's teleconference, if in principle, Mrs.Clinton might be available to attend a meeting in Montreal on the
evening of the 23rd or the morning of the 24th?
Many thanks Roberta.

Declan,
Thanks for your email. Of course it's not personal. But I do think it's
wrong.
When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treated
Northern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governments
to adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the White
House, I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congress
and in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when we
held the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast, the
dinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those in
respective Governments.
In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK, that didn't mean I
invited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform, but the
Shadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a point
of not only saying we were bi-partisan, but acted accordingly.
Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with your
Secretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through an
Economic Conference, I am obviously somewhat disappointed not to have been
invited to attend the Conference in any capacity.
That of course should never be confused with my deep respect and adMiration
for Secretary Clinton. Frankly without her help during her time in the White
House, as a Senator, as a candidate and now as Secretary, we could never
have made the progress we did. You will know that, at the time, I was always
disappointed that her contribution to the peace process and political
process was not recognized appropriately by the Conservative Party and their
spokesmen when they were in Opposition.
The decision by Owen Patterson to decide not to be present at next week's
Conference is a matter for him and the political demands he has chosen on
which to determine his priorities. You would not expect me to comment on his
decision.
However, I don't have to rehearse with you that successful long-term

It's a very New York crowd and very Diane style event (i.e. unconventional) Last year, it was held in one of the big
delegates' lounges at the UN and she redid all the chairs, etc in her patterns. The awards are all serious and DVF is the
moderator. Each awardee receives 50K for her ongoing work. The event bears no resemblance to a typical foreign policy
event, but if you were in NY, you could arrive for the awards and leave. I have no doubt you would be very warmly

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April
Henry McDonald <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/henrymcdonald>

guardian.co.uk <http://www.guardian.co.ukh , Friday 5 February 2010 11.42 GMT
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/accessibility>
Gordon Brown, Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness <http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland>'s
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773249 Date: 08/31/2015
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal

The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it.

and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
"yet another very good Friday".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.

A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. "We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be.signing up to it," she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
"We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence."
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on," Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland>'s

plan is for Shaunn to announce he will deliver a speech on Monday in the House of Commons presenting the
agreement—except that at the last second Gordon will step in on the floor for Shaun, requiring Cameron to respond,
theoretically forcing him to support the agreement. In his speech, Gordon will explicitly cite your role and support of the

Speech of Senator Lugar
Foreign Assistance and Development in a New Era
Thursday, January 28, 2010
U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar will deliver the following speech tonight at the Society for International Development's annual
dinner.
I thank the Society for International Development, its members and its leadership — Betsy Bassan and Joe Feuer — for the
work they do on development issues around the world, and for organizing this annual gala. It is unfortunate that
Chairman Kerry could not be with us tonight, but I know he shares my gratitude for your recognition.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Shah for his remarks and to recognize the efforts of USAID and its new
Administrator in responding to the tragic earthquake in Haiti. Dr. Shah has faced one of the most challenging crises
imaginable only five days after being sworn in. The job ahead of him — in Haiti and around the globe — is monumental. I
look forward to supporting his work and that of his agency in the coming years. I commend all of our responders from all

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
government agencies for their courage, compassion, and skill as they continue their mission in Haiti, and I join all of you
in extending our prayers to the people of that nation.
Tonight I would like to offer a few points about where we have come from and where we might be going with regard to
U.S. investments in development.
The challenges of global poverty and hunger are growing at a time when worries about the sustainability of natural
resources are increasing. Population growth and increased affluence in some parts of the globe will require that we
more than double world food production by 2050 to keep pace. At the same time, to address environmental concerns,
we will have to harvest that food from roughly the same amount of land that is in production today. The accessibility
and availability of food deeply affects the health of populations. Childhood malnutrition has lifelong consequences for
the productivity of individuals and nations. Poverty denies opportunity to the world's young people and breeds
extremism and instability that spills over borders. It is not surprising that the CIA has long tracked and analyzed global
food supplies as an indicator of potential conflict.
There is probably not a person in this room who would disagree that development is critical for U.S. national security
and that the alleviation of poverty and hunger is a key component. This is a sentiment that is shared in most parts of our
government, including the Department of Defense.
But even though the importance of advancing development goals is evident, constructing the most efficient,
accountable, and transparent means for achieving those goals is complex and challenging. Differences of opinion exist
with regard to who should be performing development functions and how these activities should be integrated into our
broader foreign policy efforts. We have not reached a consensus within our government on who should be doing what,
where, when and why.
As we debate these issues, we should keep in mind that diplomacy and development are two distinct disciplines.
Although diplomacy and development often can be mutually reinforcing, at their core, they have different priorities,
resource requirements, and time horizons. Most obviously, diplomacy is far more concerned with solving immediate
problems, usually associated with countries of strategic interest. Although we hope that our development efforts will
sometimes yield short-term strategic benefits, that is not their primary purpose. In a development context, we are
willing to take a much longer view of the world and devote resources to countries of less, or even minimal, strategic
significance. We are willing to allow the diplomatic and national security benefits of development work to accrue over
time. And we are willing to engage in missions for purely altruistic reasons. These differences underscore why
development must be an independent partner of diplomacy, not merely its servant.
Reforming U.S. Foreign Assistance
Reforming U.S. foreign assistance — in both substance and architecture — has been a priority for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. Secretary Clinton has stated: ""I want USAID to be seen as the premier development agency in the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
world." I share that sentiment. One of the basic questions with respect to foreign aid reform is how we can best
strengthen the capacity of USAID to run effective assistance programs. During the last two decades, decision-makers
have not made it easy for the agency to perform its mission. Development resources declined precipitously in the 1990s
and reorganization initiatives resulted in the agency's loss of evaluation, budget, and policy capacity. There is broad
consensus among development experts that the loss of these functions at USAID is inhibiting the success of our
development programs. Our development efforts will never be as effective as they should be if the agency that houses
most of our development expertise is cut out of relevant policy and budget decisions.
Events since 2001 have spurred greater investments in foreign assistance. But many of these resources have been
located outside of USAID. Roughly two dozen departments and agencies have taken over some aspects of foreign
assistance, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Agriculture.
The President has advocated doubling foreign assistance over time, and has announced new initiatives on food security
and health. Given the increased resources needed for these initiatives, it is crucial that the American people and
Congress have confidence that these funds will be used efficiently.
USAID must have a central role in development policy decisions. If we are to avoid inefficient experimentation, it must
have the capacity to evaluate programs and disseminate information about best practices and methods. That requires
policy makers to continue augmenting the agency's staffing and expertise. These principals are reflected in legislation
that Senator Kerry and I introduced last year, S. 1524, the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act.
The Administration has initiated two separate studies — the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review and the National Security Council's Presidential Study Directive on Development — in an attempt to
make recommendations on how development programs can better support U.S. foreign policy objectives. The QDDR will
not be completed until this fall and it is uncertain when, or if, we will know the outcomes of the PSD.
I am eager to review the Administration's ideas when they are ready. But in the meantime, Congress should be offering
its own ideas on how to improve our government's development capacity. The Kerry-Lugar foreign assistance reform bill
is the product of well over a year of research and analysis by Senators and their staffs. It has strong support in the aid
community. And it is co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 23 Senators, twelve of whom are members of the Foreign
Relations Committee. This level of backing for a bill related to foreign assistance is extremely rare. It provides an
opportunity to build something approaching a consensus on this issue. I am hopeful that the Executive Branch will
recognize that a bill co-sponsored by a majority of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and nearly a quarter of the
full Senate should be given substantial weight in its review process. A strong development agency that serves under the
foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State, as envisioned in our bill, will best empower her to advance U.S. goals.

Even as we reconsider our development architecture, it is vital that development policy is guided by objectives rather
than by how we organize our government to deliver development assistance. We should focus on the big issues — food
scarcity, poverty, disease, environmental degradation -- that prevent economic growth in a large swath of the world's
countries. Those objectives require that strategies reflect the needs of the countries we are helping rather than the
vagaries of our own budget process, which often allocates funds in response to lobbying pressures, media interest, or
political favoritism. Country strategies based on broad objectives also give us the best chance to avoid dependence on
arbitrary spending targets for specific sectors. For example, promoting food security requires investments not just in
agricultural productivity, but in clean water, infrastructure, basic and higher education, and land titling, to name just a
few factors.
The Global Food Security Act, which I authored with Senator Casey and which Senator Kerry has co-sponsored, reflects
these principles. The food price crisis that occurred in 2008 resulted from a culmination of policy choices by donor and
recipient governments over a decades-long period. That crisis was a wakeup call for the development community, for
international donors, and for policymakers worldwide. Because achieving food security must be a multi-sector endeavor
that goes beyond simply raising crop yields, U.S. policy must seek to integrate a variety of approaches and actors. At the
same time, we do not want to delegate responsibility for food security policy to multiple departments. That could
further weaken our already fractured foreign assistance structure. That is why our bill designates USAID, which has the
broad development experience necessary, as the lead agency to implement the strategy.
"Whole-of-Government" in Perspective
The term "whole-of-government" has come into vogue in policy circles. To the extent that the term underscores the
complexity of development problems and the need to apply the talents of a diverse set of agencies to their solution, it is
useful and descriptive. Our government must have the capacity to draw on expertise to achieve vital development
missions without artificial barriers erected by agencies. Many agencies are working together successfully on
development problems in many parts of the world.
But we should not mistake the term "whole-of-government" for an organizational strategy. Even if multiple agencies are
making contributions, someone must be in charge, someone must coordinate the activities of all involved, and someone
must take responsibility for inefficiencies and failures.
This is especially important in a development context because of our highly fragmented aid system. The risk is that the
term "whole-of-government," will be used to justify that fragmentation or preserve roles for agencies where they are
not justified. We also must be careful that the whole-of-government concept does not re-define development as a series
of technical decisions — from where to dig wells to which seeds to plant in which soils. Such a redefinition would devalue
the discipline of development, which many practitioners have spent a lifetime studying and testing. We know from long
experience that technical expertise must be grounded in an understanding of development. For example, agricultural
advancement depends as much or more on reaching women farmers, building agriculture education, and engaging civil
society in support of rural development than it does on seed quality and planting decisions. An integrated strategy can
only come from an agency that understands development is a separate discipline, as Dr. Shah has said.

I believe the starting point for any future design of our assistance programs should not be the status quo, but rather the
period in which we had a well-functioning and well-resourced aid agency. Even if we emphasize the talents of multiple
agencies, a strong aid agency that can design integrated country-specific strategies is a key to success.
Unity of Purpose
Instead of accepting whole-of-government, or any other organizational model, as the guiding narrative, I believe there is
a more helpful way of viewing the development mission — that is "unity-of-purpose." We need to be unified around
common purposes for which we can marshal the appropriate level of resources and variety of approaches. There will be
situations that call for the involvement of multiple agencies under the direction of one government entity. But, the
decision to involve other government actors should be driven by the purpose. Such is clearly the case now in Haiti. The
U.S. government and international actors are unified for the purpose of disaster response. That response involves the
coordination of hundreds of organizations to rescue people and to provide basic elements needed for survival. At some
point soon, the mission will evolve from disaster response to reconstruction to development. We should be asking
whether we will be able to maintain a unity-of-purpose even as that purpose changes.
The Lugar-Casey bill proposes that there be a unity-of-purpose around achieving global food security. Regardless of the
situation, it is the unity-of-purpose that should guide how foreign assistance is designed. I applaud Secretary Clinton for
adopting food security as a top priority. Her inter-agency team has been working diligently on its Global Food Security
and Hunger Initiative, and Congress has been responsive in appropriating funding. Many operational decisions have yet
to be made, particularly decisions relating to coordination, but I stand ready to work with the Administration to pass the
Lugar-Casey bill as soon as possible. I look forward to achieving a unity-of-purpose between Congress and the
Administration on food security.
These are not easy issues to solve. I applaud all of you here tonight for your dedication to development and your
willingness to work with Congress and the Administration as we try to rebuild our assistance infrastructure. I would
conclude with a quote from Dr. Norman Borlaug, the Nobel Laureate and Father of the Green Revolution, whose
optimism never flagged. He believed that constant striving would eventually wear down all obstacles. He said, "I cannot
emphasize too strongly the fact that further progress depends on intelligent, integrated and persistent effort by
government leaders, statesmen, tradesmen, scientists, educators and communication agencies." That is as true today as
when he said it 39 years ago, and I invite everyone here to make their own contributions in that spirit.

Speech of Senator Lugar
Foreign Assistance and Development in a New Era
Thursday, January 28, 2010
U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar will deliver the following speech tonight at the Society for International Development's annual
dinner.
I thank the Society for International Development, its members and its leadership — Betsy Bassan and Joe Feuer — for the
work they do on development issues around the world, and for organizing this annual gala. It is unfortunate that
Chairman Kerry could not be with us tonight, but I know he shares my gratitude for your recognition.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Shah for his remarks and to recognize the efforts of USAID and its new
Administrator in responding to the tragic earthquake in Haiti. Dr. Shah has faced one of the most challenging crises

imaginable only five days after being sworn in. The job ahead of him — in Haiti and around the globe — is monumental. I
look forward to supporting his work and that of his agency in the coming years. I commend all of our responders from all
government agencies for their courage, compassion, and skill as they continue their mission in Haiti, and I join all of you
in extending our prayers to the people of that nation.
Tonight I would like to offer a few points about where we have come from and where we might be going with regard to
U.S. investments in development.
The challenges of global poverty and hunger are growing at a time when worries about the sustainability of natural
resources are increasing. Population growth and increased affluence in some parts of the globe will require that we
more than double world food production by 2050 to keep pace. At the same time, to address environmental concerns,
we will have to harvest that food from roughly the same amount of land that is in production today. The accessibility
and availability of food deeply affects the health of populations. Childhood malnutrition has lifelong consequences for
the productivity of individuals and nations. Poverty denies opportunity to the world's young people and breeds
extremism and instability that spills over borders. It is not surprising that the CIA has long tracked and analyzed global
food supplies as an indicator of potential conflict.
There is probably not a person in this room who would disagree that development is critical for U.S. national security
and that the alleviation of poverty and hunger is a key component. This is a sentiment that is shared in most parts of our
government, including the Department of Defense.
But even though the importance of advancing development goals is evident, constructing the most efficient,
accountable, and transparent means for achieving those goals is complex and challenging. Differences of opinion exist
with regard to who should be performing development functions and how these activities should be integrated into our
broader foreign policy efforts. We have not reached a consensus within our government on who should be doing what,
where, when and why.
As we debate these issues, we should keep in mind that diplomacy and development are two distinct disciplines.
Although diplomacy and development often can be mutually reinforcing, at their core, they have different priorities,
resource requirements, and time horizons. Most obviously, diplomacy is far more concerned with solving immediate
problems, usually associated with countries of strategic interest. Although we hope that our development efforts will
sometimes yield short-term strategic benefits, that is not their primary purpose. In a development context, we are
willing to take a much longer view of the world and devote resources to countries of less, or even minimal, strategic
significance. We are willing to allow the diplomatic and national security benefits of development work to accrue over
time. And we are willing to engage in missions for purely altruistic reasons. These differences underscore why
development must be an independent partner of diplomacy, not merely its servant.
Reforming U.S. Foreign Assistance
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773693 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773693 Date: 08/31/2015
Reforming U.S. foreign assistance — in both substance and architecture — has been a priority for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. Secretary Clinton has stated: ""I want USAID to be seen as the premier development agency in the
world." I share that sentiment. One of the basic questions with respect to foreign aid reform is how we can best
strengthen the capacity of USAID to run effective assistance programs. During the last two decades, decision-makers
have not made it easy for the agency to perform its mission. Development resources declined precipitously in the 1990s
and reorganization initiatives resulted in the agency's loss of evaluation, budget, and policy capacity. There is broad
consensus among development experts that the loss of these functions at USAID is inhibiting the success of our
development programs. Our development efforts will never be as effective as they should be if the agency that houses
most of our development expertise is cut out of relevant policy and budget decisions.
Events since 2001 have spurred greater investments in foreign assistance. But many of these resources have been
located outside of USAID. Roughly two dozen departments and agencies have taken over some aspects of foreign
assistance, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Agriculture.
The President has advocated doubling foreign assistance over time, and has announced new initiatives on food security
and health. Given the increased resources needed for these initiatives, it is crucial that the American people and
Congress have confidence that these funds will be used efficiently.
USAID must have a central role in development policy decisions. If we are to avoid inefficient experimentation, it must
have the capacity to evaluate programs and disseminate information about best practices and methods. That requires
policy makers to continue augmenting the agency's staffing and expertise. These principals are reflected in legislation
that Senator Kerry and I introduced last year, S. 1524, the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act.
The Administration has initiated two separate studies — the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review and the National Security Council's Presidential Study Directive on Development — in an attempt to
make recommendations on how development programs can better support U.S. foreign policy objectives. The QDDR will
not be completed until this fall and it is uncertain when, or if, we will know the outcomes of the PSD.
I am eager to review the Administration's ideas when they are ready. But in the meantime, Congress should be offering
its own ideas on how to improve our government's development capacity. The Kerry-Lugar foreign assistance reform bill
is the product of well over a year of research and analysis by Senators and their staffs. It has strong support in the aid
community. And it is co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 23 Senators, twelve of whom are members of the Foreign
Relations Committee. This level of backing for a bill related to foreign assistance is extremely rare. It provides an
opportunity to build something approaching a consensus on this issue. I am hopeful that the Executive Branch will
recognize that a bill co-sponsored by a majority of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and nearly a quarter of the
full Senate should be given substantial weight in its review process. A strong development agency that serves under the
foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State, as envisioned in our bill, will best empower her to advance U.S. goals.

Re: Iran, Saudi
Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting conversation on Iran and Saudi
Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now director of the Nabucco pipeline project.) On Iran, harsh,
targeted sanctions are absolutely necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always coupled with an offer to
negotiate. The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives: According to Fischer's intelligence,
Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The regime has splits at the top. Perhaps true,
perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside sanctions puts additional pressure on internal divisions,
whatever they are. Extending an open hand while brandishing a stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver
for Iran. Its refusal to accept the open hand justifies application of the stick. Even when sanctions are enforced it always
remains useful to say another way is open. The damage done to Iran is therefore the result of its own choice. This
approach also aids the opposition. A purely condign sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and
tighten repression. Talking of regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the
regime. The opposition is a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political and moral
level. Pushed to the wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might involve thousands or tens of thousands
of political, killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have
their own bomb. The Saudis invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their bomb in
reserve.

There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I
think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I
didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear
limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -
would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,
it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,
management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite
conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major
takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)
could to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the
near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I
would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with
grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.
Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me
first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.
Thanks,
Chelsea
Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of
importance. Bolded what I think most important.:
Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to
help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the
UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I
encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off
Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and
incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN -UNDP I think - told me
she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their political rights" - when
they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)
In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,
in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/
INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures
have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie
Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head
of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a
women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a
soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of
the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of
the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2
women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100
tshirts - at least though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the
security volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774208 Date: 08/31/2015
particularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups
of 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.
Finally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less
important than the first two 'asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their
second choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at
night. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They
wanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability.
The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are
beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate
their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents
and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to
anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement
residents themselves
The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still
largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the
near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while
rebuilding over next -5 years)
The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough
or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a
proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of
which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water
supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,
IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the
largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for
-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k
today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some
which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at
night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;
settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night
while most sit in darkness)
This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects
on the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced
itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day
the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was
"such a waste of time" and he said that is representative of the government's
current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was
improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings
were "more efficient." This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible
consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs
by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The
former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very
few actor(s) reliably show up
Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled
around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements
or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;
no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding

around however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I
asked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au
Prince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO
accessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,
for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the
"UN" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how
many the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and
cars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by
UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally
acknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by
Haitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its
narrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its
reliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other
central locations
There is NO accountability in the UN system or international
humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news
but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there
is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the
40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they
would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of
the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British
Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross
subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines
The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to
put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -
important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the
settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for
settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have
already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean
latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on
security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ
drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we
were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it
appeared - on rubble cleaning.
Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the
responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to
work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the
camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli
Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4
settlements for at least the next month.
The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is
probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and
grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic
in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more
systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet

started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for
next week.
In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on
the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see
guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given
their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are
covered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.
(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian
doctors I met said, "We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]
what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves."). There is also
great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-
that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total
organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The
UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.
On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is
notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and
seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.
Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this
is familiar.):
The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN
and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective
authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the
collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know
you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,
otherwise it could be "empowered" to do this but it ostensibly already is.
However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a
single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground
organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,
latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent
settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project
management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-
cutting (e.g., pay for work)
There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from
the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,
tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,
maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse
coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I
talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.
A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,
particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions
like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food
and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those
places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent
structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774208 Date: 08/31/2015
On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with
relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in
the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent
wages until a 'market' could develop
The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the
settlements at the minimum
Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials
in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.
For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were
collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just
sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to
locals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects an
outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they
and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely
preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At
the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince
Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have
received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general
hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have
now offered to rebuild
Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both
actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help
augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible
The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners
whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work
with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any
survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,
etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term
that should accommodate a local dimension
Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission
should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work
on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for
non-earthquake related cases.
Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a
succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the
Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at
least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what
the transfer plan is
Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-
experienced chaos on Sunday
Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking
about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -
but still unclear what the action plan is
Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we
should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and
actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all

Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic
groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary
expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would
be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work
Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and
ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now
FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:
o Near term/ for the next year
■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not
in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in
place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or
being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security
and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
▪ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
• Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services
once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how
to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to
security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least
2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec
of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,
school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older
children/young adults who may be too old for initial school
plan; how to best support / help create where needed
settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,
who is in the settlements
® Over next 6-12 months:
o Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families
to return to and subsequently encourage them to do
so; government estimates this will be —30% of all
homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no
evidence base)
• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-
existing villages around Port Au Prince where
feasible to enable the government to move people

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774208 Date: 08/31/2015
out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move
400-1000 families to each of these as needed
o Longer-term:
• Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people
would move back or what the government's post-rebuild
vision looks like
■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed
before the earthquake
■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the "plan"
Context
I spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in

There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I
think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I
didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear
limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -
would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,
it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,
management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite
conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major
takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)
could do to drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the
near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I
would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with
grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.
Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me
first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.
Thanks,
Chelsea
Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of
importance. Bolded what I think most important.:
- Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to
help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the
UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I
encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off
Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic in their thinking at best and
arrogant and incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN - UNDP I
think - told me she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their political
rights" - when they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting
that....)
In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,
in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/
INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures
have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie
Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head
of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a
women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a
soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of
the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of
the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2
women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100
tshirts -though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the security

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774218 Date: 08/31/2015
volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people, particularly
women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups of 2 or 3.
They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol. Finally, they
wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less important
than the first two `asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their second choice
was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at night. Not the
Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They wanted to help
themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability from their
partners.
The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are
beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate
their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents
and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to
anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement
residents themselves
The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still
largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the
near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while
rebuilding over next -5 years)
The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough
or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a
proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of
which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water
supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,
IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the
largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for
-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k
today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some
which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at
night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;
settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night
while most sit in darkness)
This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects
on the Haitian government, including that it has now visibly distanced
itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day
the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was
"such a waste of time" and he said that is representative of the government's
current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was
improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings
were "more efficient." This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible
consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs
by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The
former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very
few actor(s) reliably show up
Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled
around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements

or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;
no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding
around however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I
asked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au
Prince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO
accessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,
for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the
"UN" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how
many the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and
cars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by
UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally
acknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by
Haitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its
narrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its
reliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other
central locations
There is NO accountability in the UN system or international
humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news
but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there
is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the
40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they
would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of
the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British
Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross
subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines
The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to
put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -
important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the
settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for
settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have
already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean
latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on
security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ
drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we
were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it
appeared - on rubble cleaning.
Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the
responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to
work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the
camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli
Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4
settlements for at least the next month.
The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is
probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and
grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic
in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more

systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet
started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for
next week.
In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on
the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see
guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given
their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are
covered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.
(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian
doctors I met said, "We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]
what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves."). There is also
great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-
that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total
organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The
UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.
On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is
notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and
seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.
Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this
is familiar.):
The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN
and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective
authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the
collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know
you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,
otherwise it could be "empowered" to do this but it ostensibly already is.
However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a
single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground
organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,
latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent
settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project
management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-
cutting (e.g., pay for work)
There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from
the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,
tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,
maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse
coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I
talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.
A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,
particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions
like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food
and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those
places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent
structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774218 Date: 08/31/2015
On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with
relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in
the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent
wages until a 'market' could develop
The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the
settlements at the minimum
Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials
in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.
For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were
collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just
sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to
locals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects an
outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they
and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely
preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At
the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince
Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have
received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general
hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have
now offered to rebuild
Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both
actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help
augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible
The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners
whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work
with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any
survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,
etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term
that should accommodate a local dimension
Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission
should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work
on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for
non-earthquake related cases.
Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a
succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the
Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at
least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what
the transfer plan is
Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-
experienced chaos on Sunday
Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking
about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -
but still unclear what the action plan is
Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we
should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and
actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all

Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic
groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary
expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would
be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work
Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and
ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now
FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:
o Near term/ for the next year
■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not
in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in
place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or
being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security
and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
■ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
■ Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services
once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how
to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to
security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least
2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec
of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,
school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older
children/young adults who may be too old for initial school
plan; how to best support / help create where needed
settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,
who is in the settlements
■ Over next 6-12 months:
• Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families
to return to and subsequently encourage them to do
so; government estimates this will be —30% of all
homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no
evidence base)
• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-
existing villages around Port Au Prince where
feasible to enable the government to move people

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774218 Date: 08/31/2015
out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move
400-1000 families to each of these as needed
o Longer-term:
■ Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people
would move back or what the government's post-rebuild
vision looks like
■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed
before the earthquake
■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the "plan"

I hope in the next few days we can focus on some of the themes in the following:
1. On 9 April, I had lunch in Kabul with expert on Afghanistan now based at
was on his way back to Washington via a meeting in Paris with the
French Political Director. He had just spend three weeks in Kandahar and Gardez, his first visit since August last year. He
came across as patriotic, but deeply worried, speaking in a monologue, mostly in French. •

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774890 Date: 08/31/2015
OVERALL SITUATION
2. aid that his assessment was that the overall situation had deteriorated sharply since his last visit. The Taliban B6
were stronger, and more confident, than ever. ISAF was inflicting heavy losses on them, but the scale was as nothing
compared with what the mujahideen had endured at the hands of the Russians. Moreover, the change in rules of
engagement — to prevent civilian casualties, and fewer night raids — had been interpreted by the Taliban as signalling
weakness on NATO's part. In i e w , most of the East, and Kunduz, was effectively lost to the Taliban and their
fellow travellers. US forces in the East controlled the ground they occupied or passed over, but little more: they were in
a similar position to the Soviet Army. Moreover, the population did not want to back them, and was resisting US
attempts to set up tribal militias or implant US Special Forces in the villages. did, however, acknowledge that he
had heard that the US Marines in Helmand were behaving much more sensitively towards the population than had been
expected. But the situation in Marjah was not good. Of course, the Marines held the ground, but violence would
continue for months or years. This did not offer the positive signal of momentum for which the Coalition had been
hoping.
KANDAHAR
3. said repeatedly that he did not understand the strategy in Kandahar. The Taliban had effectively penetrated,
an argely controlled, a city of one million people. The ANP there were largely Barakzai, and working for either or both
of the Taliban or Ahmed Wali Karzai's network. AWK was at the centre of a vast criminal enterprise: his brother-in-law
was one of the largest drug traffickers in the south. When I said that surely ISAF could gradually occupy the city,
squeezing the Taliban back and out,F7said he was not certain of that: he thought that there might well be quite
violent resistance from the Taliban. He was also dismissive of the ISAF strategy of ""managing" AWK: if the latter really
did abandon his criminal ways, he would be dead. He would lose the protection of his militias. In such situations, one
could only move forward, or go into prison or exile: there was no going back. AWK had just too many enemies to survive
in Kandahar without the protection of his own criminal networks.77guess was that AWK would promise to be
good, but in reality stick to his old habits, and hope to profit from the action taken by ISAF against the Taliban.
was dismissive of efforts to empower Governor Weesa, who would not survive five minutes in Kandahar without
Western support and protection. Although Weesa came from the area, he had no power base, and, with his Canadian
nationality, was regarded by the Kandaharis as a foreigner.
4. as also sceptical as to whether ISAF could "shura" its way to success in Kandahar. On the military side, he
thought ISAF just couldn't generate the force densities necessary to control the city: for example, he thought the
Argandab would require getting on for 15,000 troops to control it properly. The city of Kandahar would require some
10,000 fresh police, who were just not available.
NEXT STEPS
5. said he was worried about where the coalition was heading. The best that could be expected was a messy
stalemate in Kandahar, but the probability was, by the early autumn, an outcome that would not look at all like success.

r—,
■vondered whether ISAF really did need to go ahead with its plan to take Kandahar: in iew, he was riding
for a fall. I said that I did not see how we could pull back now. The planners were well aware of the risks, but wanted to
generate positive momentum to enable a political process to take hold.
MAKING PEACE
6.F7said that, in his view, the only way out now was a negotiated peace with the Taliban and all the other parties to
the conflict. He thought that Pakistan would need to help Karzai and the Americans open such a dialogue with the
Taliban, but, sooner or later, both Pakistan and Karzai would need to be moved to one side, and there would need to be
direct talks between the Americans and the Taliban. The Taliban would not make a final peace with Karzai, who had
little credibility left. Similarly, the senior Taliban leaders would need to be brought across the border into Afghanistan,
to get them out from under the control of the ISI. All this would need deception and trickery: for the first time in his
careerould see that diplomats were needed, in this case to finesse a delicate process, involving multiple
negotiations. Karzai would have to eased out, but gently and with plenty of public respect.
7. said that there would need to be a cease-fire, and wondered why ISAF couldn't occupy the high ground by
being the first to offer such a move. There would also have to be frank discussions about the withdrawal of foreign
forces.
8. said that his main worry was that the Obama Administration would waste another year ploughing on with a
military campaign which could deliver stalemate at best, and a serious reverse at worst. Then, with the 2011-12
Presidential election campaign getting going, the White House would panic, handing the problem to Pakistan, and pull
US troops out more quickly than the situation merited. It was vital to get ahead of the curve, and start making
preparations now for a messy political process that could last months or years.
9. said that he had known from 2001 that the Western intervention in Afghanistan had been fraught with danger.
He had suspected then, and knew even more strongly now, that the Taliban could not be defeated or even properly
contained by military means. Once again, he was sick with worry at the way things were going. He had thought that the
Obama Administration had understood that the solutions in Afghanistan were political, not military. He was trying to
think how he and other concerned experts could shock the Administration in getting a political grip on the situation: he
was considering a joint op-ed by a group of experts. The seriousness of the situation meant that such an article would
have to concentrate on essentials: much of the talk about counter-insurgency (in what was an Afghan civil war) and
development and governance was no more than "poetry".
10. I pointed out to the political difficulties for the US and other Western governments in negotiating direct with
the Taliban. Although the principle of a negotiated peace was accepted, more or less, in Washington and London, there
was a long way to go before politicians fully addressed what that might involve. Hence the argument that we needed -
first to get on the front foot militarily. It would help if the Taliban could be pinned down on politically neuralgic issues,
such as women's rights and social restrictions. said that, in a serious negotiation, he thought such undertakings
could be extracted from the Taliban: again, however, the sooner work started on that, the more chance of a satisfactory
result.

11. I told that much of this thinking coincided with the views expressed by the Foreign Secretary in his article in
The New York Review of Books of 29 April 2010 Phad missed the MIT speech, as he had been in Kandahar). The UK B6
election campaign meant that there was little that could be done over the next few weeks, apart from making sure that
incoming or returning Ministers had the best possible advice. After the election, there was clearly a case for a good
strategic discussion between the British Prime Minister and the American President: we all needed to raise our eyes
from the urgent tactical preoccupations in the south to the really important strategic issues, of harvesting political
success from military progress.

National office of Health that can lead and support the Department ministries in carrying out the work.
Right now we have committed to talking further with the Cubans about reconstruction efforts and in further clarifying
the role they would play with HUEH. There are many areas we could work together with the Cubans that would be
beneficial to the Haitian medical system. You will still have the opportunity to call final package. We will make sure we
are clear where our proposal overlaps with the final vision of the Haitians and other donors.

Thank you for this and for coming — I am very grateful.
I have always understood that while GOH appreciated Cuban doctors and training
I understand that frame, and assuming they have physicians and
managers, it makes complete sense.
What I still feel like is a bit of a mystery to me, though I know once Dalberg has the proposed final strategy, they will do
a careful implementation plan at the direction of you and Judith, is what exactly this means for USG specific activities.

""The Giving Pledge" At-A-Glance
WHAT: Launched by Warren Buffett during the Summer of 2010, the Giving Pledge is an effort
to invite the wealthiest individuals and families in America to commit to giving the majority of their
wealth to the philanthropic causes and charitable organizations of their choice either during their
lifetime or after their death. Each person who chooses to pledge will make this statement publicly,
along with a letter explaining their decision to pledge. At an annual event, those who take the pledge
will come together to share ideas and learn from each other.
The Pledge is a moral commitment to give, not a legal contract. It does not involve pooling money
or supporting a particular set of causes or organizations. While the Giving Pledge is specifically
focused on billionaires, the idea takes its inspiration from efforts in the past and at present that
encourage and recognize givers of all financial means and backgrounds. We are inspired by the
example set by millions of Americans who give generously (and often at great personal sacrifice) to
make the world a better place.
WHO: The Pledge currently has forty participants, listed below in alphabetical order. To date, all
are American, although a dinner is scheduled in Beijing for September 29, 2010, in hopes of
generating interest for the Pledge among wealthy Chinese.

You were so terrific at the UN. The statements of gratitude are pouring in. I will take your message to Denmark. The
Nordics will be ecstatic.
Last night at Avon, I got many messages for you from people who want to be helpful, particularly from Anna Quinlan and
Patrick Dempsey. I'm hoping to get more $ from Avon to fund VAW grants. We are inundated with requests. Reese
Witherspoon will go to Russia next year for our women's summit. She's popular there so would be good. Nothing much
has happened vis a vis Russian women and US engagement since your efforts in the 90's so we are attempting to restart
are relationship with them .They been going backwards in terms of progress.
I'm attaching the email I sent Jake and Kurt on the NZ and Australian initiatives.

I just wanted to give you some background on the initiatives that New Zealand and Australia have put together to
empower women in the Pacific region and which they would like to spotlight during the Secretary's trip.
NZ wants to announce a collaboration between us and their government to increase women's political participation in
the Pacific region. Their development agency has made this a priority for the Secretary's trip. Our hope is that S will
welcome the collaboration in her remarks at a business leaders, et al reception.
Australia wants to announce a collaboration with us on an initiative to combat violence against women in the region. I
don't know where this will be included in S's remarks, but I hope it will. Both governments are committing significant
resources; we are committing much less, but Australia and NZ are eager to partner with us to address challenges in the
Pacific region.
I wanted to briefly share some thoughts on this formed during my last trip to China. It made the collaboration with NZ
and Australia on deeper engagement with the Pacific Islands on women and development issues that much more
compelling.
I was in Shanghai and Beijing last month to speak at the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) international women's
forum to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Beijing women conference and to follow up on our interest to launch
with the Chinese government the US-China Women Leaders Forum.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775470 Date: 08/31/2015
The ACWF is a mass organization affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party with strong leaders, huge resources and
powerful mobilizing forces throughout the country. The Chair, Chen Zhili, is also the Deputy Chair of the National
People's Congress, a former State Councilor; the President, Song Xiuyan, is a former governor of Qinghai Province and
rumored to be appointed as a State Councilor after the change of central leadership in 2012. I met with both of them
when I was there.
As I walked into the welcoming dinner in Shanghai, I found almost everyone I know of significance who works on
women's issues from Southeast Asia, the Pacific and Africa in attendance. However, I did not see government reps from
Europe or NEAsia. It appeared to me that the forum was targeted to engage countries and regions where China is
expanding its influence.
I know S is going to give a policy speech in Australia during this trip. I hope that you will include our commitment to
women in the Pacific Islands, especially through these proposed collaborations with Australia and NZ.
As you know very well, the 12 Pacific Islands, though small in size, represent 12 votes in the UN. They long for our
attention and collaboration. I think women's development issues are one ideal way to further our interests and
engagement.
Have a good trip!

Judith,
Below is a rough outline of your trip to Doha, as it currently stands.
LOGISTICS:
You are currently scheduled to arrive in Doha on May 1 at 6:30 and depart May 2 at 7 pm. Traveling with you will be
Kitty DiMartino, Joe Mellott, Mark Davidson, and GSEC's LTC Eric Schoennauer. Dana Smith will fly in from the Media
Hub in Dubai to meet you in Doha.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775537 Date: 08/31/2015
Key events:
Dinner with Al Jazeera (AJ) staff: Al Director General Wadah Khanfar will host a dinner on May 1 with senior Al staff,
including AJ English Managing Director Tony Burman. We expect 7 people on the Al side and 6 on ours. (The dinner is
schedule for 8pm in a private room in the Four Seasons; post is making reservations for the party to stay in the same
hotel.)
Meeting with AJ Board Members at Al Headquarters: This will give you an opportunity to engage the Qatari leadership
of the network. Discussions topics should include the mid-May Washington visit by some AJ Board representatives. We
expect Wadah Khanfar to also participate in this meeting.
(TBC) Meeting with Prime Minister Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani (H131): As PM, HBJ is the ultimate Qatari authority
on Al. The meeting will also allow you to raise bi-lateral engagement issues as necessary. We expect to know in a few
days if HBJ will be available.
Meetings with CENTCOM: You will meet with CENTCOM staff at Al Udeid airbase just outside of Doha. The will brief
you on their within their AOR, but with particular focus on activities in
B1
1.4(D)
MEDIA:
Feature on Al Arabic: 15 minute ""feature" piece filmed at Al Studios on the Administration's commitment to
engagement with Muslim communities worldwide. This will be a good opportunity to highlight the Entrepreneurship
Summit. We can expect you to also get questions on PD programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. You will be
interviewed by one of Al's "top" journalists; exactly who is still to be determined. The interview will be in English with
simultaneous interpretation into Arabic. It will likely air a number of times on AJ.
Feature on AJ English: This would be a second 15 minute "feature" piece similar to the one for AJ Arabic. If we are
pressed for time we can consider just doing the Al Arabic feature.
Roundtable with local Qatari media: This will include journalists from a number of local Qatari media outlets. This is
another opportunity to talk about the Administration's commitment to engagement, but with a more targeted focus on
bilateral engagement and exchange programs.

Last night, as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party, a friend
approached, cell phone in hand. A few minutes earlier, she and I had been inside, chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth of
a holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. ""Richard Holbrooke died," she said.
Notwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this
sudden, awful ending was a shock, because Richard Holbrooke was such an astounding volcano of vitality. Everything about
him was large: his physical size, including the ultimate "in your face" face, a face like a Times Square billboard; his buzz-saw
voice, a highly expressive instrument, equally adept at piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty)
and forte (a high-decibel outburst of anger or indignation, almost always calculated for effect); his appetites (for experience, for
danger, for praise, for power, for fun); and his ambitions (for himself, for his beliefs, for the United States, for the world). He
was no doe-eyed peacenik, but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particular
wars. He was sentimental about his own unsentimentality, romantic about his own tough-guy realism.
Unlike my tearful informant, who had known Holbrooke as a family friend since she was a little girl, I was acquainted with him
in the casual way of many journalists and editors. He was a peer as well as a "source," a prolific and forceful writer whose
favorite venues, The New Republic and The New Yorker, happened to be the places where I've spent my working life. He was
gregarious and fond of big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw him was six weeks ago, on November 1st, at the
New York Public Library's "Literary Lions" celebration. At the pre-dinner reception, where he would normally have been on
his feet, looming large, he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife, Kati Marton, bring the party to him.
At sixty-nine he was tired—that much was obvious—but he was as sharp and voluble as ever. He still had plenty to do.
Not long after Holbrooke achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the 1995 end to the Balkan wars, I asked him
if he liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song "The Envoy." He said he'd never heard of it. The next day I sent him a CD. After
that, he mentioned it every single time I've seen him, up to and including that NYPL gala, saying he puts it on, loud, when he
needs a lift. And no wonder: his life was a drama, and he liked it that way.
If the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in 2000, then the Envoy, almost certainly, would have become the
Secretary of State, and the next decade would have unfolded very differently. As it is, Holbrooke has left a stronger, more
positive, more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post. He certainly did not die of a broken
heart—Kati Marton saw to that—but it was surely the ghastly, impossible demands of his last, impossible assignment that

brought on the rending of his aorta. He died for his country as surely as any soldier. And his deathbed words may turn out to be
the most important he ever spoke.
